(3, '2018-01-31 18:56:22', 'Welcome to the REV Blog', 1, '<p>Hello, and welcome to the first REV blog post. From the very beginning, the REV Bible has been a collaborative work that has involved a number of different talented individuals over the years. Currently, the work is being carried on by three very capable individuals who have a passion for the Scriptures and are invested in producing the highest quality translation possible to share with the world.</p> <p>Thus, to introduce the current translation team, leading the team is John Schoenheit, who has been working on the project since its inception in 2000. Joining him is Jerry Wierwille, who has been actively involved in the project since 2015, focusing on the NT text. And the most recent member of the team is Dustin Smith, who has adept language skills in both biblical Hebrew and Greek. Smith has been a critical member in enabling the project to forge ahead in the OT. He has been providing the translation of the Hebrew text and has been providing great insights on the NT text as well.</p> <p>Last year, the team translated the Book of Proverbs from the Hebrew text, completing the translation in early summer. Since then, Schoenheit and Smith have continued on with Book of Psalms. Presently, the work in Psalms has been completed past chapter 100. Before long, Psalms will be completed, and another book of the OT will be selected for translation.</p> <p>Recently, the team has begun a careful review of the NT, beginning with the Book of Jude. After Jude is complete, the review process will continue backwards through the NT, reviewing the NT letters first. The Book of Revelation and the Book of Hebrews are being put on hold temporarily on account of their length, but they will be reviewed eventually as well.</p> <p>We are very excited to be doing this work and being able to offer a sound English translation of the Bible that is both accurate and understandable. In addition to the REV Bible text, there is a growing commentary on the REV that we are constantly adding to as we study the Scriptures and work in the original languages.</p> <p>We intend to periodically update our readers and supporters on the progress of the project and where we are currently working in the text. Moreover, our goal is to also describe some of the more significant elements involved in translating in order to convey the various considerations that are involved in the translation process.</p> <p>It is our prayer that the REV is a blessing to you, and that through it the Lord may be glorified, and people may come to know him and the power of his name. Amen.</p>'),
(4, '2018-02-12 19:12:32', 'Why does Luke 16:18 seem to be out of place?', 1, '<p>Part of the reason we write the commentary we do is to help people who have questions about what they are reading, or are in Bible Study groups, or are preparing teachings or sharings, to understand the verses they are reading. An example of that came up this week when someone asked why Luke 16:18 was placed where it was. Admittedly, Luke 16:18 can seem out of place, and so we wrote commentary to help explain why that verse was where it was. Luke 16:18 shows how blind to our own sin we can be while at the same time seeming to see other people&rsquo;s sin so clearly. That certainly was the case with the Pharisees in Luke 15-16, and in Luke 16:18, Christ was helping them see their sin more clearly, although there is no record that any of the Pharisees &ldquo;got it,&rdquo; and repented.</p> <p>See the commentary on Luke 16:18.</p>'),
(5, '2018-03-01 19:55:18', 'Psalm 119: an acrostic psalm', 1, '<p>I [Dustin Smith] wanted to share with you some of the translation insights I have gleaned from going through the Hebrew text of Psalms. We have recently finished Psalm 119, and have had to think critically and carefully about how to bring out its acrostic format for the REV. An acrostic psalm is a psalm that is organized according to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and in Psalm 119 there is a different section of the psalm for each letter. The purpose of these acrostic psalms is <em>to present a full and complete picture of that psalm&rsquo;s theology and message</em>. By organizing it with every letter of the Hebrew alphabet, there is a sense of a comprehensiveness with the scope of its contents. The particular psalms that exhibit an acrostic pattern within the Book of Psalms are 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119, and 145. There are other acrostic organizations within the Hebrew Bible, such as the description of the Ideal/Strong Wife in Prov. 31:10-31, and the entire book of Lamentations is similarly ordered.</p> <p>In regard to Psalm 119, the different sections in the psalm are distinguished by the different letters of the Hebrew alphabet, beginning with the first letter, <em>aleph</em>, and ending with the last letter, <em>taw</em>. English readers are unable to see that, but neither are they able to see that every verse in a section begins with a word that begins with the letter of that section. For example, the <em>aleph</em> section of Psalm 119 involves verses 1-8, and all eight of these verses start with a Hebrew word beginning with an <em>aleph.</em></p> <p>Now as a translator who is wholly dedicated to bringing out the significance of these languages into English to the best of my God-given ability, I am posed with a problem here. How am I to bring out this deliberate and inspired ordering of this acrostic psalm so that English readers can appreciate it? Perhaps by taking the same Hebrew sound that the Hebrew letters make within their specific sections of the psalm and bring them out into English at the beginning of those sentences. Unfortunately, this will not work, because some of the Hebrew letters do not have sounds (eg., <em>aleph</em> and <em>ayin</em>). Or, perhaps I could make sure that my English sentences have their first English word correspond to the first Hebrew word lettered within the acrostic sections, thus placing emphasis on the placement of the initial words. Sadly, this too does not seem to be a prudent idea, and this creates awkwardly-worded sentences in English (that only Master Yoda from Star Wars would speak).</p> <p>With these two options off the table, I looked closely at the initial word of these organized sentences and sought to determine if there was anything special or emphatic about it. In verse after verse, the same conclusion to this question became apparent&mdash;there seems to be nothing out of the ordinary in regard to the first word which would suggest it should be heightened or stressed in its English translation. In short, I chose to render the Hebrew into good English sentences, without placing unnecessary emphasis on the initial word of each verse, despite its deliberate ordering within the Hebrew text.</p> <p>The purpose of the acrostic psalm still remains as authoritative for readers and interpreters, namely that acrostic psalms are ordered with each letter of the Hebrew alphabet in order to indicate a fullness and completeness in scope of the particular psalm&rsquo;s message and theology. In regard to Psalm 119, that message is that we should love, honor, keep, and delight in God&rsquo;s commandments, for they are righteous, holy, and good (Rom. 7:12).</p>'),

We had an interesting discussion about Gal. 2:14, where Paul confronts Peter who was a Jew living like a Gentile until men came from James. Then Peter changed and went back to living like a Jew. Eventually, even Barnabas was &ldquo;led astray&rdquo; by the hypocrisy, showing how hard it is to walk a godly walk in the midst of a lot of peer pressure not to do so.</p>'),

Also, John has been working on the background of Galatians and when the Epistle was written, and that information will soon be put into the commentary.</p>'),
(9, '2018-05-15 20:24:26', 'Work on 1 John, etc.', 1, '<p>Reworked the translation of 1 John 3 and 4. Saw things that need to be considered globally, and will schedule them to be considered. Rewrote commentary on Romans 8:1 to make it shorter and clearer. Started dealing with the Greek &ldquo;brothers,&rdquo; which often in the Greco-Roman culture referred collectively to &ldquo;brothers and sisters.&rdquo; We want the REV to accurately reflect who was being addressed in the audience.</p>'),
(10, '2018-05-25 20:18:23', 'Galatians; brothers and sisters; misc. commentary', 1, '<p>REV work continues on Galatians, with some minor changes in the REV translation, and the addition of some commentary. There have also been minor translation changes in Romans and Ephesians, and commentary entries there also. Also, and with more impact, will be the change from &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; in some verses to &ldquo;brothers <em>and sisters.</em>&rdquo; This is due to the change in our culture and terminology, to the increased need to show that women were recognized as important players in the early church; and also due to the recognition that the Greek adelphoi (the plural of &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; was used in the Greek world to refer to mixed audiences, and the Greek audience knew adelphoi meant &ldquo;brothers and sisters,&rdquo; but when adelphoi gets translated into English as &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; that information is lost. Not too many years ago it was not considered wrong to say &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; and simply expect women to know that they were included, but a change in our culture makes that much less the case today. After months of considering, and many discussions with different men and women of all ages, and also reading a book on how to translate the biblical genders, the decision was made to translate adelphoi as &ldquo;brothers <em>and sisters</em>&rdquo; when it could be demonstrated that a mixed audience of men and women were being addressed.</p>'),
(11, '2018-06-22 13:32:23', 'New work all over', 1, '<p>Lots of work is being done all over the Bible, both in translation and in the commentary. Leviticus, Joshua, Ruth, and Haggai are some of the books where there have been changes and additions, and there have been major changes in Galatians and Ecclesiastes as our REV translation team goes through those books. Look for greatly enlarged commentary in Galatians that helps clarify that book.</p>'),
(12, '2018-08-08 20:09:11', 'Work in Ezekiel', 1, '<p>For a couple weeks there has been work going on in Ezekiel, especially Ezekiel 1, 8, and 1:10. We learn much from Ezekiel, including that when things look bleak and hopeless, God is still on the throne and our lives matter. Ezekiel was a priest without a temple, but God did not abandon him, but called him into service as a prophet.</p>'),
(13, '2018-08-24 15:30:41', 'Download the REV in MS Word!', 1, '<p>The REV keeps improving. This week it became available to download and print each book of the REV Bible in MS Word format instead of just pdf. Reading the REV in hardcopy can be a great blessing and now it can be easier. Once you download a book in Word, you can change the font, highlight stuff, add notes for teachings, and more. We are very blessed to be able to offer this new development to you.</p> <p>Work in the REV and commentary continues, with more commentary and translation. This week a large commentary was added in Exodus 4:21 to explain why the Bible says Yahweh hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, when Yahweh did not modify or remove Pharoah&rsquo;s free will. It is an important topic, and one that Erasmus and Martin Luther disagreed vehemently over some 500 years ago (with Luther taking the postion that God did in fact take away Pharaoh&rsquo;s free will and force him to defy God).</p>'),
