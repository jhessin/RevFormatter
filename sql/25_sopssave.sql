The Magi brought incense, which made a wonderful gift because it was very portable, quite expensive, and easy to sell. Incense of various kinds was used in all kinds of things, for example in most temples, and places of worship, and also it was burned regularly in many homes.</p> <p>Wendell Phillips writes, &ldquo;Today we can scarcely appreciate the role of incense in the ancient world because, for one thing, it is difficult to imagine the odors of that world, requiring clouds of sweet-smelling smoke to cover them.&rdquo;[fn]</p> <p>Basically, the whole ancient world smelled terrible, and there were lots of reasons for that: smelly people, smelly clothes, human and animal excrement all over, dead animals (and people) rotting in the open, and garbage and more garbage everywhere you looked.</p> <p>Most of the people in the ancient world bathed seldom if ever, so we can imagine what they smelled like. While there were public baths in some of the Roman cities, a lot of people did not get to take much advantage of them and there was no truly effective deodorant soap. Furthermore, the vast majority of the people did not or could not wash their clothes. For the most part, the people and their clothes stank.</p> <p>Also, very few places had an effective way of handling the bodies of dead people and animals, human and animal excrement, of which there was a lot, and normal garbage, which ended up being dumped everywhere. We must remember that there was no &ldquo;public works department&rdquo; of the government that took care of sewage, dead bodies, and garbage.</p> <p>Gregory Aldrete writes about Rome and other larger cities which had very large problems but the same basic problems as other smaller cities and towns:</p> <blockquote> <p>&ldquo;The streets of Rome were breeding grounds for numerous disease-causing organisms due to the widespread presence of human and animal cadavers in various states of decomposition as well as the copious quantities of raw sewage deposited in the streets.</p> <p>&ldquo;The normal course of events produced enormous numbers of dead bodies, many of which were not properly disposed of. The truly impoverished who could not afford to join a burial club or who lacked nearby family members to cremate or bury their bodies, along with Rome&rsquo;s large population of homeless and beggars, simply lay where they dropped or else were thrown into the Tiber [River] or into open pits just outside the city. It has been estimated that the city of Rome produced perhaps 1,500 such unclaimed [human] bodies per year [and many animal bodies as well].</p> <p>&ldquo;A number of literary anecdotes vividly illustrate the presence of both bodies and scavenging animals in the streets of the city. The poet Martial describes the gruesome death of a beggar whose last moments are spent trying to fend off the dogs and vultures that have gathered to feed on him (Martial, <em>Epigrams</em> 10.5).</p> <p>&ldquo;Although Rome possessed some sewers, their purpose was more to provide drainage than to actually carry away waste. While latrines were sometimes present in buildings&hellip;most often they were not, suggesting that people relieved themselves in the streets or in chamber pots. Unfortunately, most city inhabitants appear to have emptied their chamber pots by simply dumping them out the windows of their dwellings. Much of Rome&#39;s garbage and sewage seems to have ended up in the streets. This was no small problem since, at its height, Rome&rsquo;s human inhabitants were producing about 50,000 kilograms [over 55 tons] of excrement each day. &hellip; Rome&rsquo;s animals certainly also contributed to the general level of filth. Thus the streets of the city probably more closely resembled open sewers than our modern notion of roadways.&rdquo;[fn]</p> </blockquote> <p>The fact that the ancient world stunk produced a great demand for incense. For example, the Beloved in Song of Solomon speaks of a sachet of myrrh between her breasts, which would have given off a pleasant odor. The golden incense altar in the Tabernacle/Temple was to be burned twice a day every day (Exod. 30:7-8). The fact is that cities stunk up until our modern age. As long as things and people moved by horse and carriage there was always some amount of dung in the streets, and truly modern toilets and sewers were not commonly used until the mid-1800s.</p>', 'Phillips, <em>Qataban and Sheba</em>, 4.~~Aldrete, <em>Daily Life in the Roman City</em>, 97-99.'),

They thought that Jesus&rsquo; conquering the earth was going to happen later on in his ministry; they did not yet know, and never really understood until after his resurrection, that he was going to die. Yet now, with 20-20 hindsight, we can see some things he taught are about his second coming (Matthew 16:27 (cp. Mark 8:38; Luke 9:26); Matt. 24:30-44 (Mark 13:26; Luke 21:27); Matt. 25:31-46; 26:64 (Mark 14:62); Mark 8:38; Luke 12:40; 17:24-30; John 14:3, 18; 21:22). The Old Testament also is worded such that it seemed the Messiah was only going to come one time. Nevertheless, we today can look at the Old Testament and see that some of them are speaking of Jesus&rsquo; Second Coming even if the people of the time did not know it (cp. Isa. 63:1-6, Dan. 2:34-35, 44; and Zech. 14:3-6, and there are many more that speak of Christ ruling the earth, which we today know he will do after his Second Coming.</p> <p>The &ldquo;Second Coming&rdquo; is not &ldquo;the Rapture,&rdquo; which is a totally different event that is best described in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18. In the Rapture, Jesus does not land on earth, but Christians are taken up into the air to be with Christ. There is a debate among Christians who believe in the Rapture (some do not believe there will be one) as to exactly when it will occur and whether it is before all the tribulation described in Revelation, during it, or after it, but all agree that the Rapture and the &ldquo;Second Coming&rdquo; when Christ physically comes to earth and conquers it, are different events.</p> <p><strong>&ldquo;with his angels in the glory of his Father.&rdquo;</strong> In the future, there will be a time of great tribulation; a time of terrible destruction and death. The Old Testament prophets spoke of it often (see commentary on Dan. 12:1), Jesus Christ taught about it (Matt. 24, Mark 13, Luke 21) and it is described in some detail in the Book of Revelation which says there will be seal judgments, trumpet judgments, thunder judgments, and bowl judgments. That time of great tribulation will end when Jesus Christ comes down to earth and fights the Battle of Armageddon and conquers the earth (Rev. 19:11-21). Then Jesus will set up his 1,000-year kingdom on earth. There will be the resurrection of the righteous (the first resurrection; Rev. 20:1-5) and the Sheep and Goat Judgment (Matt. 25:31-46), and Jesus will reward those people for what they had done for him. Other scriptures also speak of Jesus coming with his angels when he comes to earth (Matt. 13:41; 16:27; 24:31; 25:31; Mark 8:38; 13:27; Luke 9:26).</p> <p>[For more on the Sheep and Goat Judgment, see commentary on Matt. 25:32 and 25:33. For more about Jesus&rsquo; future kingdom on earth, see Appendix 3, &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s Future Kingdom on Earth.&rdquo;]</p> <p><strong>&ldquo;he will repay each <em>person</em> according to what he has done.&rdquo;</strong> The teaching that on Judgment Day people will get what they deserve, good or bad, based on what they have done in their life is taught many times in Scripture (e.g., Job. 34:11; Ps. 62:12; Prov. 24:12; Jer. 17:10; 32:19; Ezek. 33:20; Matt. 16:27; Rom. 2:6; 1 Cor. 3:8; see commentary on Psalm 62:12). The Greek is <em>apodidōmi</em> (#591 ἀποδίδωμι), and it means to give or give out; to pay, repay, or fulfill a contractual obligation, to reward or give a recompense. It is used in both a positive sense (Matt. 6:4) and a negative, or bad sense (Matt. 12:36). In this verse, the word &ldquo;repay&rdquo; can refer to a good repayment, if the person has obeyed God, or a bad repayment if the person has disobeyed God. Those people who have completely ignored God and not even gotten saved will be &ldquo;repaid&rdquo; by being thrown into the Lake of Fire and burned up (see commentary on Rev. 20:10). Those people who have gotten saved will be &ldquo;repaid&rdquo; with everlasting life, and also rewarded in the future Millennial Kingdom, for what they have done for Christ (see commentary on 2 Cor. 5:10, &ldquo;good or evil&rdquo;).</p>', 'Lenski; cp.

God created us to be emotional beings and to strongly desire being part of a family or group. The desire to &ldquo;belong&rdquo; is so strong in most people that they will deny themselves and what they believe just to keep from being ostracised. But being a dedicated follower of Christ often leads to persecution and being ostracised (2 Tim. 3:12). Here in Luke 6:22, the Greek word translated as &ldquo;denounce&rdquo; is the strong Greek word <em>ekballō</em> (#1544 ἐκβάλλω), which means to throw out, drive out, or send out, often including the idea of violence. In this case, &ldquo;denouncing your name&rdquo; is not a calm dismissal, but an emotional rejection of you, your reputation, and what you stand for.</p> <p>Also, the text is not &ldquo;denounce you,&rdquo; but &ldquo;denounce your name.&rdquo; In the biblical culture, a person&rsquo;s name was more than just a moniker that pointed the person out. It stood for the person, his or her reputation, what the person stood for&mdash;his or her values and ideals&mdash;and usually the family, group, or tribe to which the person belonged. Proverbs 22:1 says, &ldquo;A <em>good</em> name is to be chosen over great wealth.&rdquo; We pray &ldquo;in the name&rdquo; of Jesus Christ. When the apostles healed the lame man, the Jews asked, &ldquo;By what power, or in what name, have you done this?&rdquo; They knew names were powerful. We baptize people &ldquo;in the name of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Act 10:48), and we heal and cast out demons &ldquo;in the name of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Acts 3:6; 16:18). It is a horrible experience to have someone denounce your name because it denounces you, your reputation, what you stand for, and can even include your group or family. But Scripture says if we are denounced because of believing the truth about Jesus Christ, we are blessed, and we should think and act that way. The truth is not how we feel, but how we stand before God and Jesus.</p>', null),

Mark 14:14; Luke 22:11). The word for &ldquo;inn&rdquo; is <em>pandocheion</em> (cp. Luke 10:34).', '<p><strong>&ldquo;And she gave birth.&rdquo;</strong> The record of the events surrounding the birth of Christ occurs in Matthew and Luke, and the two Gospels interweave when it comes to the chronology of the events. To read about the birth of Christ in chronological order, it is: Luke 1:5-80; Matt. 1:18-25; Luke 2:1-38; Matt. 2:1-22. Then Matt. 2:23 and Luke 2:39-40 are both summary statements about Jesus growing up in Nazareth.</p> <p><strong>&ldquo;firstborn son.&rdquo;</strong> The word &ldquo;firstborn&rdquo; (<em>prōtotokos</em>, #4416 πρωτότοκος) here foreshadows the birth of Mary&rsquo;s other children. She had at least six children besides Jesus: James, Joseph, Simon, Judas, and at least two daughters. Jesus was God&rsquo;s &ldquo;only begotten&rdquo; son, but Mary&rsquo;s &ldquo;firstborn&rdquo; son. Mary and her sons, Jesus&rsquo; brothers, are mentioned in Matthew 13:55-56 and Luke 8:19.</p> <p><strong>&ldquo;laid him in a manger.&rdquo;</strong> A huge difference between houses in the ancient Near East and our modern houses was that in biblical times in Israel if a family owned one or two farm animals, it was common to bring them into the house at night. Farm animals were very expensive, and most families owned only a few, if any, so they were brought into the home at night to keep them from being stolen and to protect them from harm. The woman in Endor who King Saul visited at night had her calf in the house with her: &ldquo;And the woman had a fat calf in the house&rdquo; (1 Samuel 28:24, KJV). Of course, if the family were shepherds or herdsmen, they would not bring the whole flock or herd into the house, but would have a family member or a hired guard watch them in the field&mdash;which was why the shepherds were in the field watching their flocks on the night Jesus was born.</p> <p>It was a common practice to raise the floor of the part of the house where the family lived and to keep the animals in an area that was a little lower, even if only a few inches lower.[fn] This lower area would keep the animal waste from coming in to where the family lived and slept. Also, Jesus was laid in a manger, which is an open trough, box, or bin where the animal food was placed so the animals could feed easily. In Western society, animals and mangers are in barns or stables, and since Jesus was laid in a manger, it made sense to Europeans that Jesus was born in a stable and so that became a fixed part of the traditional Christmas Story. However, in biblical society in the Middle East, where the animals grazed outside during the day and were brought into the house at night, if a family owned a manger, it would almost always be in the house. The manger would keep the animals calm, just as many modern farm animals have a feeding trough in their stall. The manger would be in the main part of the house, never in the guest room, which is why the text says that Jesus was placed in the manger &ldquo;because there was no place for them in the guest room&rdquo; (Luke. 2:7 <em>Common English Bible</em>, 2011).</p> <p>People in the ancient Near East around the time of Christ knew that a manger would be in the house, so the shepherds knew to look for the baby in a house. Nevertheless, not everyone who had an animal would have a manger, and what seems especially unusual was that in Jesus&rsquo; case he was placed in the manger, but the reason that the family placed him there is not stated. It certainly was not to demean him, so it was likely to protect him from busy feet and drafts in the house. The unusual act of putting baby Jesus in the manger became part of the sign that the angel gave to the shepherds, and no doubt confirmed to them that they had found the right baby. If every newborn baby was placed in a manger, then the fact that Jesus was in a manger would not have been much of a sign to the shepherds. We learn from Luke that sometime shortly after Jesus was born, he was safely placed in the manger, which would have been filled with clean hay or straw and would have been a safe place for him.</p> <p>The angel gave the shepherds the sign that they would find the baby wrapped in swaddling cloth and lying in a manger. That sign helped confirm the angels&rsquo; words that this baby was the promised Savior.</p> <p><strong>&ldquo;no space for them in the guest room.&rdquo;</strong> The very fact that where Joseph and Mary were staying had a guest room shows us that Jesus was born in a private house. Greek is: διότι οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῖς τόπος ἐν τῷ καταλύματι. [διότι (because) οὐκ (not) ἦν (there was) αὐτοῖς (for them) τόπος (a place, a space) ἐν (in) τῷ (the) καταλύματι (guest room)]. Young&rsquo;s Literal Translation (1862), which is similar to the REV, reads, &ldquo;there was not for them a place in the guest-chamber.&rdquo; Some more modern versions are similar: the CEB (<em>Common English Bible, 2011</em>) reads, &ldquo;there was no place for them in the guestroom&rdquo; while the NIV2011 reads, &ldquo;there was no guest room available for them.&rdquo; The reason the text would say they &ldquo;laid him in a manger <em>because</em> there was no space for them in the guest room&rdquo; was that the guest room would never have a manger. The main room of the house might have one if the homeowners had animals, but the guest room would never have a manger.</p> <p>There are a number of reasons why Joseph and Mary could have found a place to stay in Bethlehem even if they arrived there months before Mary gave birth (these reasons are also enumerated by Kenneth Bailey.[fn] First, Joseph was returning to his town of origin. Historical memories are long in the Middle East, and family support is very strong. For example, Paul knew he was a descendant of Benjamin the son of Jacob, but Benjamin had lived more than 1,500 years before Paul. Once Joseph announced that both he and Mary were descendants of families from Bethlehem, many homes would be open to them.</p> <p>Second, both Joseph and Mary were &ldquo;royals,&rdquo; from the royal line of David. David is so famous in Bethlehem that it is called, &ldquo;the city of David&rdquo; (Luke 2:4, 11). Being from that famous family would have meant that most homes would open their doors to him.</p> <p>Third, in every culture women about to give birth are given special help. As Kenneth Bailey puts it: &ldquo;Was there no sense of honor in Bethlehem? Surely the community would have sensed its responsibility to help Joseph find adequate shelter for Mary and provide the care she needed. To turn away a descendent of David in the city of David would be an unspeakable shame to the entire village.&rdquo;[fn] If for some reason Bethlehem was so totally filled with guests and visitors that no one would open their homes to Joseph and Mary, their relatives Zechariah and Elizabeth lived only a short distance away, in the hill country of Judah (Luke 1:39, NASB), and Joseph and Mary could have gone there with only a little effort. In fact, Mary had visited Elizabeth early in her pregnancy (Luke 1:40). So Joseph and Mary could have found adequate housing and care if they needed it.</p> <p>Another reason we know Joseph, Mary, and baby Jesus were being well taken care of is that when the shepherds arrived soon after the birth of Jesus, they saw the young family and their newborn Messiah and then left. God&rsquo;s people had waited thousands of years for this Messiah, and if the baby Messiah was not in good circumstances when the shepherds saw them, they would have immediately been confused, offended, and outraged, and taken the whole family back to their own homes. The fact that they left Joseph, Mary, and Jesus where they were shows they were satisfied that their Savior was being well taken care of.</p> <p>Furthermore, the phrase &ldquo;no room in the inn,&rdquo; which appears in many Bibles, is a mistranslation of the text. Joseph and Mary were not rejected by a local hotel that had its &ldquo;no vacancy&rdquo; sign turned on. The phrase &ldquo;no room in the inn&rdquo; is a mistranslation that continues to support a very serious misunderstanding about the birth of Christ. Two Greek words we must understand to properly interpret the biblical account are <em>topos</em> (#5117 τόπος; usually translated &ldquo;room&rdquo;), and <em>kataluma</em> (#2646 κατάλυμα; usually translated &ldquo;inn&rdquo;).</p> <p>The word translated &ldquo;room&rdquo; in the traditional phrase &ldquo;no room in the inn&rdquo; is <em>topos</em>, and it occurs more than 90 times in the New Testament. <em>Topos</em> does not refer to &ldquo;a room,&rdquo; like we might think of a hotel room today, but simply a place or space in a given area. In the inns and caravansaries of the ancient world, a person did not rent a &ldquo;room&rdquo; like we today would rent a hotel room. The guest rented a &ldquo;space&rdquo; to sleep, and there was no guarantee who or how many people might end up &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; (or staying up carousing or having sex with a male or female prostitute) in the &ldquo;space&rdquo; with you. It is extremely unlikely that Joseph and Mary would have even agreed to go to an inn for her to give birth, they were generally loud places with a rough crowd, almost any house would have taken in a woman in labor to offer help and support. The word <em>topos</em> is used over 90 times in the Greek New Testament, and here in Luke 2:7 is the only place it is translated &ldquo;room&rdquo; in many English versions as if it referred to a hotel-type room for Joseph and Mary to stay in.</p> <p>The Bible says there was no &ldquo;space&rdquo; available for Joseph and Mary in the <em>kataluma</em>. What is the <em>kataluma</em>? It does not refer to a commercial lodge, or inn, but simply means a &ldquo;lodging place&rdquo; or &ldquo;guest room.&rdquo; The BDAG Lexicon says of <em>kataluma</em>: &ldquo;lodging <em>place</em><strong><em>.</em></strong> The sense <em>inn</em> is possible in Luke 2:7, but in 10:34 Luke uses <em>pandocheion</em>, the more specific term for <em>inn. Kataluma</em> is therefore best understood here as lodging or guest-room.&rdquo; To properly understand the birth narrative of Jesus Christ, it is vital that we understand that the normal Greek word for &ldquo;inn&rdquo; is <em>pandocheion</em> (#3829 πανδοχεῖον), and it refers to a public house for the reception of strangers (caravansary, khan, inn). <em>Pandocheion</em> was not only used by the Greeks, but was used as a loanword for &ldquo;inn&rdquo; or a commercial lodging place in Hebrew, Arabic, Armenian, Coptic, and Turkish. <em>Pandocheion</em> is the word Luke uses in the parable of the Good Samaritan when he wanted to refer to a public inn (Luke 10:34).</p> <p>In contrast to the <em>pandocheion</em>, the public inn, when the Gospels of Mark and Luke use <em>kataluma</em>, it means &ldquo;guest room&rdquo; (Mark 14:14; Luke 22:11). When finding a place to eat the Last Supper with his disciples, Jesus tells them to say to the owner of the house, &ldquo;The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room [<em>kataluma</em>], where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?&rdquo; (Luke 22:11). So in both Mark and Luke, the <em>kataluma</em> is a room in a man&rsquo;s house. Luke also uses the verb form of <em>kataluma</em>, which is <em>kataluō</em> (#2647 καταλύω), and means &ldquo;to find rest or lodging.&rdquo; In the record of Jesus and Zacchaeus, Jesus goes &ldquo;to be the guest&rdquo; at Zacchaeus&rsquo; house, not at a public inn (Luke 19:7). So Luke also uses the verb such that &ldquo;to stay in the <em>kataluma</em>&rdquo; indicates lodging at someone&rsquo;s house. So the text is telling us that at the birth of Jesus, there was no &ldquo;space in the guest room,&rdquo; and we will see that it indicates that they stayed in the main quarters of the house.</p> <p>Given all the evidence in the Bible and culture, the Bible should not be translated to say there was no room for them in the inn, but rather there was &ldquo;no space for them in the guest room.&rdquo; It is noteworthy that <em>Young&rsquo;s Literal Translation of the Bible</em>,[fn] by Robert Young, the same man who produced <em>Young&rsquo;s Concordance to the Bible</em>, translates Luke 2:7 as follows: &ldquo;&hellip;there was not for them a place in the guest-chamber.&rdquo; When the NIV translation was first published in 1984, Luke 2:7, quoted above, read, &ldquo;there was no room for them in the inn,&rdquo; but when the NIV was edited and republished in 2011, Luke 2:7 was changed to more correctly read, &ldquo;because there was no guest room available for them.&rdquo; So by 2011, the NIV translators recognized that &ldquo;inn&rdquo; should have been translated as &ldquo;guest room.&rdquo; The NIV apparently left the Greek word <em>topos</em> untranslated, or it might have read, &ldquo;there was no space in the guest room for them.&rdquo; Similarly, when the original Holman Christian Standard Bible (HCSB) was published in 1999, Luke 2:7 read, &ldquo;there was no room for them at the lodging place,&rdquo; but when that Bible was updated in 2017 and published as the Christian Standard Bible (CSV), Luke 2:7 was updated to read, &ldquo;there was no guest room available for them.&rdquo;</p> <p>To understand the birth of Christ there are also some features of common houses in the Middle East that we must understand. One custom was that it was very common for houses in the Middle East to have a guest room where guests, and even strangers, could stay. Even poor people could have a guest room because it did not have to be furnished or have an adjoining bathroom and shower. People did not generally sleep on beds, but traveled with their own blankets that they slept on at night, so sleeping arrangements were no problem. Tables and chairs were not used in the common homes of first-century Palestinians, and the bathroom was a pot, or a place outside. So the average guest room was simply a small, empty room, offering shelter and a place of safety. The guest room provided privacy for the guests as well as the family.</p> <p>Showing hospitality to strangers has always been a huge part of Eastern life, and the Bible has quite a few records of people showing hospitality to strangers. For example, Lot housed two strangers (Gen. 19:1-4), and the man in Gibeah housed strangers (Judges 19:19-21). The Shunammite woman wanted to show hospitality to Elisha and had a guest room built on her roof just for him (2 Kings 4:10). Giving hospitality was important enough that it became a command for Christian leaders (1 Tim. 3:2). The Eastern custom of giving hospitality continues in the modern Muslim culture, and thus one of the five pillars of the Muslim faith is to be quick to entertain strangers. The home Joseph and Mary stayed in had a guest room, but it was being used by other guests.</p> <p>The second thing we must understand is that it was common for people to bring their animals into their houses at night. They did this to keep them from being stolen and to protect them from harm. Usually, the floor of the family dwelling was raised up somewhat, and the animals were in an area that was a little lower.[fn] John Nolland writes: &ldquo;&hellip;it is best to think of an overcrowded Palestinian peasant home: a single-roomed home with an animal stall under the same roof (frequently to be distinguished from the family living quarters by the raised platform floor of the latter).&rdquo;[fn] That families brought their animals in at night explains why the manger was in the house. The manger would not have been in the guest room.</p> <p>When Joseph and Mary arrived in Bethlehem they were taken into one of the local homes, most likely of a relative. However, there was no space available for them in the <em>kataluma</em>, the guest room. Therefore, the family made room for Joseph and Mary in their own living quarters, and the baby Jesus was placed in a manger in the home, which would have been filled with clean hay or straw and would have been the perfect size for him.</p> <p>The fact that the record says there was no room for them in the guest room does not mean that Joseph and Mary had just arrived. Lots of people may have been traveling to Jerusalem for the registration. Many scenarios are possible. One is that the guest room had been occupied for weeks; another is that when other people arrived for the registration or the feast, that Joseph and Mary moved from the guest room into the main house because they were closer relatives or to better care for Mary. The Bible is simply letting us know that Jesus was placed in the manger in the house because the family guest room was occupied.</p> <p>Understanding the birth narrative in this way highlights another important aspect of Eastern hospitality. In the East, guests were given special treatment of all kinds, including behavior that seems very extreme to us. For example, in the record of Lot and the two strangers, Lot would have handed over his own daughters to the mob before surrendering his guests (Gen. 19:8). The people whom Joseph and Mary stayed with would not displace their guests from the guest room, but instead inconvenienced themselves, and gave the young couple space in their own living quarters.</p> <p>Another thing we need to know is that Mary and Joseph would not have been alone when Jesus was born. Actually, Joseph would not have been there at all, while the women of the household, along with the women of the family staying in the guest room, most likely the village midwife, and perhaps even wise and experienced women from the neighborhood, would have been present. Joseph and the other men of the household would have graciously left the house to the women while Mary gave birth, something that was completely normal for birth in a village in Israel. Someone with a modern Western mindset may say, &ldquo;Well, the Bible does not say those other women were there.&rdquo; Of course not. We remind the reader that if something was normal for the culture, it was not usually written about. The details of a woman giving birth are never given in the Bible. No serious Bible student should insist that the women in the Bible who are mentioned giving birth (and there are dozens of them) did not have other women present to help them just because those helpers are not specifically mentioned in the text. That would be absurd. No details of Jesus&rsquo; birth are given in the Bible because births were a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; part of life, and no first-century reader in Palestine would expect anything different than what usually happens with a village birth. In fact, if the women of the household had not been there to help Mary, that would have been so unusual and seemingly coldhearted that that fact probably would have been written in the Bible.</p> <p>Thus, what actually happened at the birth of Jesus is considerably different than what is commonly taught in Christian tradition. It is not that Bethlehem was full of cold-hearted townspeople who refused to take special care of a family about to give birth. Joseph and Mary arrived in Bethlehem sometime before she gave birth. The guest room of the people who gave them lodging was full, so the family opened their own home to them and took them into their living quarters. When Mary gave birth, in the late evening or the night some days later, the men left their own home to accommodate her and give her privacy, and no doubt baby Jesus was born in quite usual circumstances, most likely with the village midwife and no doubt helped by the women of the family. Shortly after, the new baby Jesus was wrapped in swaddling clothes, dedicated to God, and placed in a perfect spot, the manger in the home.</p> <p>While Mary was in labor and giving birth in the house, the man who owned the house, along with his sons and Joseph, would have been outside or perhaps in the home of a neighbor, giving Mary the privacy she needed during the birth of Jesus. Once Jesus was born, a woman would announce that a baby boy had been born, and there would have been the standard shouting, music, and joyful celebrations that were part of the birth celebration of a baby boy. It is worth noting that in the eastern culture at the time of the Bible, the birth of a boy was loudly celebrated, while the birth of a baby girl was not celebrated. The reason is simple: the boy brought strength and wealth into the family, while the girl did not. It was usual for a girl to be married by her mid-teens, and she would leave her parents&rsquo; house and live with her husband and his family and thus add to his family, not her birth family. If her husband lived in a different village than her parents, then she likely only saw her birth family rarely if ever. Also, any children she bore were part of the husband&rsquo;s family and clan, not that of her birth parents. Furthermore, at the time of Christ when a girl married, she brought a dowry with her, thus taking physical wealth from her house. (This was a shift from ancient times when the man paid the dowry to the girl&rsquo;s family; the shift occurred after the Babylonian Captivity (David Fiensy, <em>The Archaeology of Daily Life, p. 156</em>)). So the baby girl would be loved, but her birth would not be a cause for family celebration. Sometime after Jesus was born and the women had made sure that things in the house were back in proper order and Mary was comfortable, the men would have been allowed back in the house to see the baby.</p> <p>[For information on the Magi and the Christmas story, see commentary on Matthew 2:1.

The word translated &ldquo;tabernacle&rdquo; is literally more like &ldquo;booth,&rdquo; like the temporary structure found in gardens, especially as harvest approached. The idea behind the whole verse in its context is that God&rsquo;s people disobeyed and deserted Him, so He treated His dwelling like a booth in a garden after harvest. He let it be destroyed. At the time the Temple was destroyed by Babylon it was a magnificent edifice, but in God&rsquo;s eyes it was no less temporary than a booth in a garden or the Tabernacle; without God&rsquo;s presence, it was just another building.</p> <p><strong>&ldquo;as if it were <em>a booth</em> in a garden.&rdquo;</strong> The word &ldquo;garden&rdquo; refers to an enclosed area. Farmers and even homeowners would own enclosures of land that they grew vegetables and crops in to feed themselves and even sell the produce. These were not &ldquo;hobby gardens,&rdquo; but neither were they &ldquo;farms.&rdquo; They were small areas for serious planting for food. Temporary booths in people&rsquo;s &ldquo;gardens&rdquo; that gave shade for watchmen during the harvest were common, and that seems clearly to be the analogy the writer is drawing here. R. B. Salters writes: &ldquo;The situation is not so corrupt as is sometimes claimed. &hellip;If we read the phrase not &lsquo;as a garden&rsquo; but &ldquo;as in a garden,&rdquo; then the entire statement can be rendered &ldquo;he has torn down his booth as in a garden&rsquo;, meaning &lsquo;he has torn down his booth as one tears down a booth in a garden (R. B. Salters, <em>A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on Lamentations</em>, p. 131).

Sadly, Israel and Judah had been very sinful as nations. Zechariah 3:8 says that Joshua and the other men who were with him were signs, they represented things, and Joshua represented the spiritual side of Israel. In the vision, God removes the filthy garments on Joshua (Zech. 3:4-5), and what that symbolizes is that God will remove the sin of Israel (cp. Zech. 3:9).
