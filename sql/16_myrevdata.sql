The difficulty is that, the Apostles themselves never obeyed this command ; and in the rest of the New Testament there is no hint as to its ever having been obeyed by anyone. Baptism was always in the name of the one person of the Lord Jesus. Acts ii. 38. &quot; Be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.&quot; Acts viii. 16. &quot;They were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.&quot; Acts x. 48. &quot; He commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.&quot; Acts xix. 5. &quot; They were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.&quot; It is difficult to suppose that there would have been this universal disregard of so clear a command, if it had ever been given; or it ever really formed part of the primitive text.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;It is a question, therefore, whether we have here, something beyond the reach of the science, or the powers of ordinary Textual Criticism. As to the Greek MSS. there are none beyond the fourth Century, and it seems clear that the Syrian part of the Church knew nothing of these words. Eusebius quotes this verse no less than eighteen times, and always quotes it in this form, &quot; Go ye into all the world and make disciples of all nations.&quot; He omits all reference to &quot;baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.&quot; Now Eusebius, the great Ecclesiastical historian, died in 340 A.D., and his work belonged, therefore, in part to the third century. Moreover, he lived in one of the greatest Christian Libraries of that day. If the Greek MS. there contained these words it seems impossible that he could have quoted this verse eighteen times without including them. Professor Lake (now of the University of Leiden) and Mr. Conybeare have called attention to this fact, and shown that neither Justin Martyr (who died in 165 A.D.), nor Aphraates, of Nisibis (who flourished in Syria, 340 A.D.), knew anything of these words. It looks, therefore, as though the words got into the text (perhaps from the margin) in the Church of North Africa; and that the Syrian Churches did not have them in the MSS. at their disposal. The point is interesting. The difficulty is there. And if there be any truth in Professor Lake&#39;s argument, then that would be a reasonable explanation of it. If this be not the explanation, then we submit that the verse must be rightly divided, and the command must be understood as referring entirely to the future preaching of &quot; the Gospel of the kingdom &quot; in the coming new Dispensation ; and as having no place in this present Church period, which is the Dispensation of Grace. It is clear that some sort of &quot; dividing &quot; of the word of truth is necessary, for the whole verse as it stands is in conflict with Matt. x. 5 &quot;go not into the way of the Gentiles.&quot; If those words refer to the then Dispensation, when the Kingdom was at hand ; then Matt, xxviii. 19 may refer to the coming Dispensation, when the Kingdom shall be again proclaimed, and then the &quot;all power,&quot; given unto Christ, shall be exercised in heaven and on earth.&rdquo;</p>'),

They are full of coaching about the furthering of the ministry that Paul had been given and theyalso reveal a sense of impending alarms for the Christian community. Paul envisions Timothy&rsquo;s part in the solving of these problems on a practical level and his instructions always point to the Doctrine that had already been established by Paul (&ldquo;my gospel&rdquo;) and the other apostles and prophets of the early community. With this in mind we find in the middle of the first epistle to Timothy a section a strange verse that speaks of church management, but then seems to refer to Jesus. I present a couple of well-known versions and will then comment on them.</p> <p>KJV1 Timothy 3:14-16 14 These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly: 15 But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. 16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</p> <p>NAU1 Timothy 3:14-16 <a id="_Hlk22372539" name="_Hlk22372539"></a>14 I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you before long; 15 but in case I am delayed, I write so that you will know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth. 16 By common confession, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was revealed in the flesh, Was vindicated in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Proclaimed among the nations, Believed on in the world, Taken up in glory.</p> <p>When noting the subject matter here, we see that Paul is still focused on &ldquo;the household of God, the church of the living God&rdquo;. This continues the overall theme of chapter 3 which instructs Timothy about how &ldquo;overseers&rdquo; and &ldquo;deacons&rdquo; should conduct themselves not only in their own household, but in this household of God, the church. By the time he summarizes all of this with Timothy it has been noted that deacons (ministrants/ servants) in the church need to &ldquo;keep the secret of the faith with a pure conscience&rdquo;. This sacred trust relates, as we shall see, to the &ldquo;secret of godliness&rdquo; in verse 18. This term secret is the key to the entire context.</p> <p>So, in verses 14 and 15 the subject concludes a diatribe about church government and living, but in almost all translations the next verse is coopted. It begins withthe &ldquo;secret of godliness&rdquo; as either &ldquo;God was manifested in the flesh&rdquo; or &ldquo;he was manifested in the flesh&rdquo;. This verse seems to wrench the subject matter from the context and begin an entire new stream of thought; or does it. Scholars have questioned the underlying Greek text for years (see below), but have remained steadfast in their interpretations that verse 16 is about a personality not a object. Left without critical comment it seems to talk of Jesus who was not the church. Why is there such a problem here?</p> <p>Bad textual critical work on the part of early midlevel compilers (authors of the extus Receptus and others) and the corresponding translations from extant/ errant texts of the time is the issue facing us. Yet it is interpreters even today that further obscure a better translation that are the real problems. Strangely, the Greek syntax and grammar are not necessarily the issue, though a will comment on a relative pronoun and it&rsquo;s modifier. It is really a logical and modality issue. It is readily seen that verse 15 and 16 point to &ldquo;things&rdquo;, not personal subjects. Verse 15 talks of the church and verse 16 the &ldquo;secret of godliness&rdquo;. Why do most translations change this neutral subject matter into Jesus between verses? It has to do with the Greek of the second phrase and what it is describing. The first part of verse 16 (&ldquo;confessedly great is the secret of godliness&rdquo;) is agreed upon universally. What is the sedond phrase?</p> <p>BNT 1 Timothy 3:16b - o]j evfanerw,qh evn sarki,( - &ldquo;Which&rdquo; or &ldquo;who&rdquo; was manifested in the flesh&rdquo;.</p> <p>The first word (ὅς) is at issue; what was the original text and what is the translation? Here are the textual facts as described by text critic Bruce Metzger:</p> <p>&ldquo;The reading which, on the basis of external evidence and transcriptional probability, best explains the rise of the others is ὅς [&ldquo;who,&rdquo; &ldquo;which&rdquo;]. It is supported by the earliest and best uncials (א* A*vid C* Ggr) as well as by 33 365 442 2127 syrhmg, pal goth ethppOrigenlat Epiphanius Jerome Theodore Eutheriusacc. to Theodoret Cyril Cyrilacc. to Ps-Oecumenius Liberatus. Furthermore, since the neuter relative pronoun ὅ must have arisen as a scribal correction of ὅς (to bring the relative into concord with μυστήριον [mystery]), the witnesses that read ὅ (D* itd, g, 61. 86 vg Ambrosiaster Marius Victorinus Hilary Pelagius Augustine) also indirectly presuppose ὅς as the earlier reading. The Textus Receptus reads θεός [God], with אe (this corrector is of the twelfth century) A2 C2 Dc K L P Ψ 81 330 614 1739 Byz Lect Gregory-Nyssa Didymus Chrysostom Theodoret Euthalius and later Fathers. Thus, no uncial (in the first hand) earlier than the eighth or ninth century (Ψ) supports θεός [God]; all ancient versions presuppose ὅς or ὅ and no patristic writer prior to the last third of the fourth century testifies to the reading θεός. The reading θεός arose either (a) accidentally, through the misreading of ΟC as ΘC, or (b) deliberately, either to supply a substantive for the following six verbs, or, with less probability, to provide greater dogmatic precision.&rdquo; (Bruce Metzger, A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament).</p> <p>So, the reading &ldquo;God was manifested in the flesh&rdquo; is wrong, but then why substitute &ldquo;He&rdquo;? Why not rather read the relative pronoun as &ldquo;which&rdquo; to bring verse 16 into correspondence and coherence with the context of &ldquo;the secret of godliness&rdquo;? Then the relative pronoun would make more sense. Let me explain. The term &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; (in most translations; from the Greek noun musth,rion (musterion)) is more properly explicated as &ldquo;secret&rdquo; and should always be translated not transliterated. It has nothing to do with a &ldquo;mysterious God&rdquo; or &ldquo;God works in mysterious ways&rdquo; or sacraments, mystery religions of the time or anything our modern minds can concoct. I has deep roots in the Hebrew Scritptrues and in the Second Temple literature. In a great work by Raymond E. Brown, S. S. he proves this conclusively. It was something hidden, a secret; no one knew.</p> <p>And the secret of godliness, a non-personal noun phrase does not necessarily relate to Jesus or about Jesus; so why stick a theology in here? The term &ldquo;manifested in the flesh&rdquo; was too tempting. It sounded too much like &ldquo;And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us&hellip;&rdquo; of Johns&rsquo; Gospel. A pre-existent Christ now comeinto existence! And the term &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; seemingly used similarly? What a perfect place for the monks to monkey with the text&hellip;and so they did and the last verse in a chapter about church polity is mysteriously changed into a comment about Jesus the God-man. Yes, the &ldquo;idea became real&rdquo;. Well, let&rsquo;s just hold our proverbial horses, shall we?</p> <p>The semantic range of the Greek term &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; is vast in Christian Scripture and certainly holds this type of meaning. Originally it was merely the physical &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; coveromg the skeleton, then metaphorically the carnality that opposes God and spirituality and many, many, many other usages figuratively. Interestingly it had been provided by Paul in his letter to the Ephesians which offers a context that mentions another &ldquo;great secret&rdquo;; the relation of a husband and a wife where they become &ldquo;one flesh&rdquo;. This &ldquo;flesh&rdquo;; this reality of one-life-out-of two-brought-togeterh; not physical, not carnal, not always understood by the world is unique. Yet Paul in Ephesians 5: 32 says,</p> <p>BBE Ephesians 5:32 This is a great secret: but my words are about Christ and the church.</p> <p>Paul is speaking of the church and uses the same phraseology. The same term &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; is used as well in that context (Ephesians 5: 29, 31). How does that help us here in the discussion of the &ldquo;secret of godliness&rdquo;? One takeaway is that Paul uses the term &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; as reality; the husband and wife become one flesh. Not one physical body, not a carnal relationship opposed to God, not somting pointing to a worldly mindset, but something that has come into being from an idea just as John used it as relating to Jesus in his Gospel. This is how I propose to see the &ldquo;manifested in the flesh&rdquo; phrase in 1 Timothy 3: 16. Something that was an idea had become a reality. And it was a secret idea.</p> <p>It is &ldquo;great is the secret of godliness, which was manifest in the flesh&rdquo; (came into being; was evident), not &ldquo;God was manifest in the flesh&rdquo; nor even &ldquo;he was manifest in the flesh&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s much bigger than that. It is about Christ and the church here as it was similarly in Ephesians 5. Let me show you more. The next phrases in the verse reveal more eye-opening details and each refers to the launched subject of Paul&rsquo;s third chapter of 1 Timothy, the church and church polity. I&rsquo;ll repeat the first phrase and continue with those parallel modifiers:</p> <p>1. That which was revealed in the flesh (became a reality)</p> <p>2. (it) was &ldquo;vindicated in the Spirit&rdquo; (&ldquo;was given God&#39;s approval in the spirit&rdquo; &ndash; Bible in Basic English)</p> <p>3. (it was) &ldquo;seen by angels&rdquo;</p> <p>4. (it was) &ldquo;proclaimed among the nations&rdquo;</p> <p>5. (it was) &ldquo;believed on in the world&rdquo;</p> <p>6. (it was) &ldquo;taken up in glory&rdquo;</p> <p>There is a logical progression to observe. Something was revealed in the flesh. This same &ldquo;thing&rdquo;, I believe it was the church, that we know as Christianity in the Christian Scriptures, was &ldquo;vindicated (&ldquo;made such as it ought to be&rdquo; (dikaio,w &ndash;&ldquo;justified&rdquo; or just as it ought to be) is another translation)) in (&ldquo;via&rdquo; or &ldquo;with&rdquo;) the spirit&rdquo;. God gave the &ldquo;promised holy spirit&rdquo; on Pentecost 28 AD and marked his work by even giving some extra special, might I say secret stuff. The Jews that day spoke in tongues as evidence (can you say, &ldquo;in the flesh&rdquo;?) of that vindication.</p> <p>Why, then would Paul say next that this same entity was &ldquo;seen of angels&rdquo;? Because angels were not expecting this; they were unaware of this; they were surprised! How do we know? Paul has told us in 1 Corinthians 2: 6-8 and Peter explains their desire (&ldquo;longing&rdquo; or &ldquo;lust&rdquo;) to know about this &ldquo;thing&rdquo; (in 1 Peter 1: 10-12). The ancillary question to Trinitarians would be why would this relate to Jesus? He as announced to have been coming by angels. His coming; may I say not only coming, but arrival, place of birth, viariaous life, murder, resurrection, ascension and seating by God&rsquo;s throne and even his second coming were all &ldquo;seen of angels&rdquo; from the Scripture. And, of course, his actual arrival was celebrated my a &ldquo;multitude of the heavenly host&rdquo; some nine (9) months after Gabriel himself announced the promise. Being &ldquo;seen of angels&rdquo; is not a statement about Jesus. This seition is about something they hadn&rsquo;t seen, hadn&rsquo;t known about; the secret of godliness!</p> <p>&ldquo;Proclaimed among the nations&rdquo; comes next and why is this important in the linear timetable; because thats what came next in the rise and expansion of the church of God. Messiah, his birth, suffering, murder, resurrection, ascension and seating was only a Jewish thing with a Jewish Messiah expected. The &ldquo;crumbs from the table&ldquo;Gentiles, the &ldquo;dogs&rdquo;, the ungodly &ldquo;uncircumcision&rdquo; were to get holy-hell from Messiah and his host bdfore it was all over. They were to be bringing the wealth of their world to the Jews in Jerusalem in the eschaton; they were to be &ldquo;ruled witih a rod of iron&rdquo; by Messiah; just read that in a million places in the Hebrew Scriptures and don&rsquo;t forget Psalm 2. What is up with this present statement by Paul? This &ldquo;proclamation&rdquo; is different; it was spoken of by Paul in his letter to the Romans.</p> <p>NAU Romans 16:25 Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching (proclamation, heralding) of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery (Secret) which has been kept secret for long ages past,</p> <p>The ministry of the church of God to the Gentiles is quite a bit different than that of the children of Israel. The Gentiles, who were spoken of as, &ldquo;excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world&rdquo; (NASBEphesians 2: 12); arguably a pretty bad national trajectory; are now, by the proclaiming of the church they are:</p> <p>&ldquo;&hellip;are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, 7 of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God&#39;s grace which was given to me according to the working of His power<a id="_Hlk22729122" name="_Hlk22729122"></a>. 8 To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable (&ldquo;unsearchable&rdquo; or &ldquo;untrackable&rdquo;) riches of Christ, (NASBEphesians 3: 6-8)</p> <p>I&rsquo;d say that &ldquo;unsearchable&rdquo; thing alone, which angels desired to see, was exceptionaly different from the prophecies given for the future Gentiles. And yesthose prophecies will be fulfilled once the church leaves the planet and new rules are set for the next stage in God&rsquo;s purposes; all Israel will be saved and Messiah comes back and kicks butt / takes names. God&rsquo;s words will not fall idly to the ground. Jesus Christ has become a minister to the Circumcison to fulfill the promises given to their fathers (Romans 15: 8). Early translations have that Jesus Christ was a minister, obscuring the textual truth of the matter. The conflict between Israel and the other nations is not &ldquo;history&rdquo;; they have a bloody future. There will yet be head-banging (Read: &ldquo;rod of iron&rdquo;) in Jesus&rsquo; future. He&rsquo;s not coming back blowin&rsquo; kisses. But the secret, that Gentiles in the &ldquo;dispensation ofthe Secret&rdquo; would be treated in a much more, shall we say, preeminent way; this was new, and they needed to hear it from preachers. After the cross they got the message. And one more thing before we move on; Jesus was not proclaimed to the Gentiles until after his resurrection, ascension and seating next to God.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ve heard the argument, however, that this preaching was just after is resurrection, before his ascension (those 40+ days between the Feast of Unleavened Bread andPentecost 28 AD) and because of his pronouncements about going to the nations and baptizing them (Matthew 28: 19). His mission and that of his disciples during his pilgrimage on the planet was only to Israel. Jesus would not allow his own preachers of the good news of the Kingdom to come to be to anyone but &ldquo;the lost sheep of the house of Israel&rdquo; (Matt. 10:6; 15:24). As the keen reader will attest, this modifier of the leading noun is out of place chronologically if it were to be about Jesus. But it is perfect chronologically and logically if it were about the Christian church.</p> <p>The final two (2) modifiers of the &ldquo;secret of godliness&rdquo;, the &ldquo;believed on in the world&rdquo; and &ldquo;taken up in glory&rdquo; speak loudly to this point as well. Yes, Jesus was believed on in the world, but it was after he was taken up in glory. Jesus was preached to the Gentiles, but it was after he was taken up in glory. The &ldquo;taken up in glory&rdquo; would have been point #4 not point #7 and it isn&rsquo;t that way in any Greek text.</p> <p>Yet, the trajectory of the church, the subject of this third chapter to Timothy(&ldquo;church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth&rdquo;) follows the points (modifiers) that Paul uses distinctly, logically and chronologically. And verse 16 says that there is no argument about this &ldquo;secret of godliness&rdquo;; it was a commonconfession (o`mologoume,nwj - homologoumenosas - &ldquo;agreed&rdquo;, &ldquo;by common consent&rdquo;). I believe that better hermeneutic is as follows:</p> <p>&bull; That which (&ldquo;the secret of godliness&rdquo;) was revealed in the flesh - became a reality (in similar fashion to Jesus (the &ldquo;Word&rdquo;) &ldquo;became flesh&rdquo;;; but this time its&rsquo; not Jesus)); both the church and the Messiah were in the mind of God and one was secret.</p> <p>&bull; (it was) &ldquo;given God&#39;s approval in (with) the spirit&rdquo;) &ndash; Pentecost 28 AD; speaking in tongues as evidence so no one would miss it.</p> <p>&bull; (it was) &ldquo;seen by angels&rdquo; &ndash; This was necessary because it was previously a secret that they didn&rsquo;t know nor could they; it was &ldquo;hid in God&rdquo;</p> <p>&bull; (it was) &ldquo;proclaimed among the nations&rdquo; &ndash; <a id="_Hlk22882337" name="_Hlk22882337"></a>after Jesus was gone to heaven</p> <p>&bull; (it was) &ldquo;believed on in the world&rdquo; - after Jesus was gone to heaven; because of the &ldquo;proclamation of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the Secret&rdquo;</p> <p>&bull; (it was) &ldquo;taken up in glory&rdquo; &ndash; This is not Jesus being taken up to heaven, but the church in the Rapture.</p> <p>This scenario fits all the circumstances; keeps the chronologiical sequencing and makes contextual sense whereas sticking Jesus in the context is otherworldly and downright deceitful.</p> <p>Bob&rsquo;s Translation: &ldquo;Beyond all question (confessedly), great is the Secret of godliness which was manifested in the flesh, given God&#39;s approval in (with) the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.&rdquo;</p> <p>P4 &ldquo;secret of godliness&rdquo; in verse 18.</p> <p>P5 that verse 16 is about a personality not aobject.</p> <p>P6 though awill comment on a relative</p> <p>P9 be translated(,)not transliterated.</p> <p>I(t) has deep roots in the Hebrew</p> <p>Second part of P10 coveromgthe skeleton</p> <p>one-life-out-of two-brought-togeterh;</p> <p>P11 not somtingpointing to a</p> <p>phrase in 1 Timothy 3: 16.

It is the gospel Paul was commissioned to deliver [Ho], and was given to him by revelation from Jesus Christ [NAC]. By this phrase Paul reminds us that the gospel was committed to him, that he was separated unto it and he identified with it [Mu]. This phrase serves as a reminder that preaching the gospel to the Gentiles is Paul&rsquo;s particular call [Rom 1&ndash;8, p. 172] [BECNT]. Paul is not referring to something particular in his expounding the gospel, but rather that he knows it, espouses it wholeheartedly, and has made it his own [Mor].

Along with the gift of the eschatological Spirit, it was the resurrection of Christ that radically altered Paul&rsquo;s (and the early church&rsquo;s) understanding of present existence as both &ldquo;already&rdquo; and &ldquo;not yet.&rdquo; In Jewish eschatological expectations these two events, above all, would mark the beginning of God&rsquo;s final wrapup. Very early on the church recognized that the Resurrection (Christ&rsquo;s) had already set the future in motion. Paul in particular saw the implications of this reality, which are spelled out in some detail in 1 Corinthians 15. The resurrection of Jesus, he argues there, makes our future resurrection both necessary and inevitable: necessary, because even though death has been de-fanged as it were, it still remains as God&rsquo;s and our final enemy, but it will cease to be with our resurrection; and inevitable, because Christ&rsquo;s resurrection set something in motion as &ldquo;first-fruits&rdquo; that guarantees the final harvest. Precisely [Phil, p. 330] because of the latter (Christ&rsquo;s resurrection as guaranteeing ours), Paul understands the life of the future to be already at work in the present.<br /> &nbsp; The reason for starting his explanation of &ldquo;knowing Christ&rdquo; with this word is twofold, and related to the ultimate concerns of the rest of the present appeal. First, the primary focus in what follows lies on the future, hence the connection between the two A lines: the power inherent in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection guarantees our own resurrection.56 Second, and more apropos to Paul&rsquo;s immediate concern, present suffering, and especially Paul&rsquo;s urging the Philippians to &ldquo;rejoice in the Lord&rdquo; in the context of suffering (2:17&ndash;18), makes sense only in light of the resurrection of Christ.57 Without the power inherent in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, present suffering (even for Christ&rsquo;s sake) is meaningless.<br /> &nbsp; That alone explains the unusual language of this phrase, &ldquo;the power of his resurrection.&rdquo; Nowhere else does Paul speak of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection in quite this way, of its inherent power, which by implication is made available to those who are his.58 Indeed, when speaking elsewhere of the &ldquo;power&rdquo; available to believers in the present age, he associates power with either God or the Spirit.59 But here &ldquo;knowing Christ&rdquo; first of all means knowing &ldquo;the power of his resurrection&rdquo; because the present subject matter is &ldquo;knowing Christ,&rdquo; and the empowering dimension of knowing him is reflected in his resurrection. Thus Paul has come to know, and continues to desire to know, the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection at work in his present mortal body. As he puts it in the similar passage in 2 Cor 4:7&ndash;17, in these present &ldquo;jars of clay&rdquo; we &ldquo;are always being given over to death for Jesus&rsquo; sake so that his life might be revealed in our mortal body&rdquo; (2 Cor 4:11).<br /> &nbsp; On the other hand, we know enough about Pauline theology from what he says elsewhere to add that his experience of the Spirit is the way the power of the resurrection is available to him and them. After all, this personal [Phil, p. 331] narrative begins with the assertion that must be understood to be presuppositional throughout: that in contrast to the backward-looking Judaizers, Paul and the Philippians presently live the life of the future by the power of the (eschatological) Spirit of God (v. 3).&rdquo; (Fee, NICNT)</p>'),

The backing for the instruction that Paul gives in v. 18 suggests that at least in some cases more than respect in the form of acknowledgement i.e. some form material compensation might be meant.15 Moreover, something on this order for those engaged in ministry was clearly the practice in Pauline churches (1 Cor 9:7&ndash;14; 2 Cor 11:8&ndash;9; Gal 6:6; 1 Thess 2:7). But it is well to recall that Paul himself did not lean on the material implications for himself, though he did expect to be treated with the respect to be accorded to those in the service of the gospel. The precise meaning of the stipulation, &ldquo;double honor,&rdquo; is difficult to determine.16 Of the numerous interpretations offered,17 the Pauline practice just cited and the following OT citation (and adaptation in Paul) and allusion to the Jesus tradition point in the direction of &ldquo;honor&rdquo; that could sometimes be expressed in material terms.18 &ldquo;Double&rdquo; might then have meant [1,2 Tim, Titus, p. 364] literally &ldquo;twice as much as&rdquo; some implied or earlier named group, whether it be other elders who do not teach, deacons, widows,19 or figuratively &ldquo;great, more, most, or additional&rdquo; in a superlative sense.20 Surely elders who were householders and who had &ldquo;led well&rdquo; had no need of double pay; but the appropriateness of urging community acknowledgement of their faithfulness is perfectly sensible in the situation of false teaching&rdquo; (Towner, NICNT)</p>'),

But what are the believers to have fear about? Some answer that it is a fear &ldquo;of sinning&rdquo; (added by NASB). Certainly this is right as far as it goes, but the larger picture needs to be considered. The public rebuke brings about this fear. Thus the fear of receiving such a public rebuke is as much in view as the fear of sinning (cf. Calvin). Others are to be reminded by the public rebuke of the seriousness, shamefulness, and disciplinary consequences of sin. Since Paul is influenced by Deuteronomy&rsquo;s demand for two or three witnesses, it is likely that in this remark he is also influenced by Dt. 13:11, which indicates the result of an act of discipline: All (LXX πᾶς) Israel will be afraid (LXX φοβηθήσεται, the cognate to φόβος here) of the discipline and thus will withdraw from the sin.&rdquo; (Knight, NIGTC)</p>'),

Furthermore, such a precaution will also keep those who lay on hands from sharing responsibility for the sins of one they might otherwise have prematurely set apart.<br /> &nbsp; The key word is ταχέως, which is used in its unfavorable sense, i.e., &ldquo;too quickly,&rdquo; &ldquo;too easily,&rdquo; or &ldquo;hastily.&rdquo; That which should not be done &ldquo;hastily&rdquo; is χεῖρας ἐπιτίθει. ἐπιτίθεναι χεῖρας (or χεῖρα; the combination in the NT 19x; cf. ἐπίθεσις τῶν χειρῶν) is &ldquo;to lay on hands&rdquo; and is used with reference to several things in the NT. Since this section has been dealing with elders, it is natural to understand Paul to be using the concept here, as he has elsewhere, with reference to elders, i.e., for the public means by which they are set apart for the office of elder (so elsewhere in the PE: 4:14, which see; 2 Tim. 1:6). On &ldquo;no one&rdquo; (μηδενί) should hands be laid &ldquo;hastily&rdquo; to set him apart as an elder. Timothy, who with the other elders lays on hands (again 4:14), is commanded as the apostolic representative to see that the process of selecting an elder (cf. Acts 6:1&ndash;6) does not place himself (and the other elders) in a predicament.<br /> &nbsp; Paul focuses on that consequence in the second part of the verse. μηδέ, &ldquo;nor&rdquo; or &ldquo;and not,&rdquo; continues the preceding negation (μηδενί). κοινωνέω means generally &ldquo;share,&rdquo; and here &ldquo;participate,&rdquo; i.e., in sins (ἁμαρτίαις) in the sense of being responsible for them (see especially 2 Jn. 11; cf. Ezk. 3:18; 33:6, 8). By placing a person in an office that has as one of its qualifications that the person be &ldquo;above reproach&rdquo; (3:2), the one laying on hands will seem to be condoning the sins that that person commits (ἁμαρτίαις referring back to the ἁμαρτάνοντας of v. 20).

Referring to his spirit can be equal to us referring to our souls. The soul of Tim is Tim&rsquo;s self. &ldquo;Oh my soul, why are you sad?&rdquo; is me talking to myself. I think that by God saying it this way: &ldquo;the spirit of God&rdquo;, God was saying that he personally did this, not by commanding other beings to do it. God can and does take credit for the things he commands other spirit-beings to actually do, which is the right of a ruler. But I think this is making it clear that God Himself was going into action to straighten out the mess that other created spirit-beings had made of his creation. I don&rsquo;t think that this necessarily means that no part of the 6 days was delegated to his loyal spirit-beings, but that God was stepping in to a situation that He had largely left in the hands of his spirit-being sons of God.</p> <p>We know from Ephesians 1 that God&rsquo;s plan included a man, later named Jesus, who would eventually unite all families on earth and in heaven under one head, himself (and that the Body of Christ of this administration, &ldquo;Christians,&rdquo; were also in this plan). God had this plan in mind before &ldquo;the foundation of the earth&rdquo;. I think that phrase means that before the initial creation, God planned that a particular man, whom he would conceive in a woman, and who would be perfected through enduring sufferings, would eventually pay the price for all of humanity&rsquo;s sins (which sins had an astronomically high probability of happening due to free will which He was going to give spirit-beings and mankind). God would raise that man from the dead, and raise him up into the heavens to sit at His right hand over all of His creation.</p> <p>An integral part of God&rsquo;s plan, before mankind could be created, was to create various families of spirit-beings, whose normal abode is in heaven, and whose purpose in their service to God was to take care of the unseen/spiritual foundations of God&rsquo;s creation (the heavens), to maintain it in a stable state under His rulership, under His direction, in order for God&rsquo;s purposes to come to pass, including humans. John S does a great job of laying out how it is God&rsquo;s way to delegate responsibility to other beings and that He does not micro-manage everything they do. That is not love. How much the spirit-beings knew of this plan is not revealed here. Certainly more was revealed in the revelation of the sacred secret.</p> <p>Verse 2 shows how terribly unsucessful they were at their responsibilities (formless, empty, and with darkness...). Failing this badly must have intention to it. [Now, document that.] They were not doing it well enough to even keep earth capable of having the living things that God wanted to live on it, including humans. God&rsquo;s plans were in jeopardy. He had to step in in a big way to save His plans. God Himself took action, and John S&rsquo; has comments on this as well.</p> <p>[Hypothesis:]There are a lot of physical constants that physicists/comologists know exist, but they don&rsquo;t know why they work, they just do. They also know that if these were to change, even the slightest, then huge changes would happen to the universe. There are also things in &ldquo;space&rdquo; that they know about which could annihilate earth, but that there are a lot of fortunate happenstances that protect the earth. It can easily be seen that spirit-beings who are designed to care for the nest that the earth rests in (the heavens), could also affect changes that were not so good for the earth.</p> <p>Though &ldquo;formless&rdquo; is good, it could use other words like &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; or &ldquo;purposeless&rdquo;, or even including both tohu and bohu: &ldquo;an empty purposeless waste&rdquo;. I feel that &ldquo;formless&rdquo; gives the idea of etherial, or like a nebula, but it could also be be like a lot of mud, and water sliding around too which seems to fit the idea of darkness on the face of the deep and a lack of dry land. However, from what Arthur Custance says, the definitions seem to point at it being compared to a wilderness, or waste area, that cannot support life. Whether it became this way, or it is simply saying that at the time directly before God hovered over it, THE EARTH WAS (or BECAME...). Verse 1 is not a chapter heading because the earth exists and it is referred to as God&rsquo;s creation, so God had to have created it before verse 2, hence verse 1. This thing called earth not only was, but it has adjectives. It exists before God said: &ldquo;Let there be light.&rdquo;</p>'),

More important is what this light is in comparison to Day 4 when the Sun, Moon, and stars were set in the heavens. This could be the usage of light as that which exposes the deeds, the works of those that it shines on, which in this case would have been the deeds of spirit-beings who were causing the conditions mentioned in verse 2. His next action was to separate the light from the darkness, which in this context means the critique of the works that were good from those which were evil, thus making a knowledge of good and evil within the spirit-realm.</p>'),

This is our earth, we are the God-given rulers of earth, not the Devil, who influences us to give it to him by obedience to him.</p> <p>Hypothesis: Adam gave him <u>some</u> of his dominion by eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The transfer of authority is limited to the nature of the sin. He brought two things into the world: the sin-nature (sin-affected/influenced nature), and the sentence to death (death). Adam still had authority from God to rule animals, and plants, and the earth&rsquo;s resources but there would be a state of hostility, a power struggle between mankind and the Devil&rsquo;s crew. God did not imprison or kill the Devil or his loyal followers but he took away their authority and power so that they would be oppressed and humiliated and defeated all the days of their lives. So where do they get their power to affect earth? They get it from people, the rightful rulers, who obey them. They are empowered by the sin of people. This is how they get their authority, in pieces, by the individual sins of others. It is complicated, but true. Luke 4:6 &ndash; the Devil says that the authority was delivered to him, yes, but not all by one sin. It never attributes his almost complete control of the world to Adam only. But he works through the sin-affected-nature of mankind which is passed down to all of Adam&rsquo;s progeny, and he works through the fear of death to influence people even more. By those things, all men have sinned in some way, or ways. Though he was tempted in all ways like we are, Jesus did not sin at all. Even Adam and Eve were tempted by external forces (the manifestation of the Devil as a glorious son of God) before they sinned and afterward the sin-nature made them temptable internally. Jesus, not having that sin-nature, could also be tempted by external things. The sin-nature allows temptation to come internally.</p> <p>After Adam and Eve&rsquo;s sin of eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil the Devil was cursed. Here is the REV commentary on the first part of that curse:</p> <p>&ldquo;on your belly you will go.&rdquo; The serpent in the Genesis record is not a literal snake, it is the figure hypocatastasis for the Devil [see commentary on Gen. 3:1, and also see Appendix 14: &ldquo;Names of the Devil,&rdquo; under &ldquo;serpent&rdquo;]. In spite of that, however, God uses idioms that apply to a snake when talking to the Devil. Genesis 3:14 is a good example, because the idiom &ldquo;to crawl on your belly&rdquo; is an idiom for <strong>oppression and humiliation</strong>, and even today that kind of idiom is used (Ps. 44:25).</p> <p>&ldquo;you will eat dust.&rdquo; This idiom refers to being <strong>defeated; &ldquo;utter defeat.&rdquo;</strong> We can see it being used in Psalm 72:9. We still use the same idiom for being defeated today, although usually in the context of being a loser in some kind of race or contest. The Devil, that &ldquo;ancient serpent,&rdquo; will always be defeated. He wins minor skirmishes, but he has been defeated over and over for thousands of years now, and eventually will be totally defeated and destroyed.</p> <p>And yet, he holds sway over the whole world. Wow! Confessing our sins, and stopping ourselves from sinning now is a key to power in the spiritual battle. We also need to manifest holy spirit to receive information and powerful works to do by our Lord&rsquo;s power. By his grace, we can do more than we can by our own godliness.</p>'),

Sinning in one way leads to sinning in more ways. Corruption yields more corruption. It all affects a person negatively. This corruption also affects society. People who recognize the creator God &ndash; Yahweh &ndash; will also feel some of the affects of the corruption of their society by those who reject Him. Corrupt laws, corrupt TV, corrupt internet things, corrupt businesses, corrupt employers, corrupt lawyers, corrupt ministers, it all affects the blessings of God on the land. Our lives can be affected by it all. We should work at maintaining our holiness, our separation from the corruption.

For example, lignins make hardwood trees hard. They are a complex group of organic compounds found in the cell walls of plants that give structural rigidity to the plants&rsquo; overall growth and architecture. One type of plant lignin contains sulphur, while the other is sulphur-free. It&rsquo;s the sulphur-bearing lignins that form the fundamental structural basis of all hardwood trees used for lumber products.</p> <p>This botanical fact casts an interesting theological light on Genesis 6:14, where God instructs Noah to build a large ship. The Ark allowed him and his family (eight people total) and various representatives of the animal kingdom to survive the impending global Flood and repopulate the earth. Specifically, Noah is commanded, &ldquo;Make yourself an ark of gopher wood.&rdquo;1</p> <p>Much confusion has been connected to the term &ldquo;gopher wood.&rdquo; No one seems to know exactly what the Hebrew word גֹפֶר, or g&ocirc;pher, really means, and this is the only place in the Bible where it&rsquo;s used. The King James and the New King James versions wisely leave the word untranslated. Other Bible translations have inserted different types of wood, such as cypress, but this is speculation.</p> <p>When we dig deeper into the Hebrew, we begin to find enlightening connections. G&ocirc;pher is actually a root of the word גֹפֶרית or gophr&icirc;th, which is translated seven times in the Old Testament as &ldquo;brimstone&rdquo; in the context of God&rsquo;s fiery judgment on human wickedness.2 Examples would be Genesis 19:24: &ldquo;Then the LORD rained brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah&rdquo;; and Psalm 11:6: &ldquo;Upon the wicked He will rain coals; fire and brimstone and a burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.&rdquo;</p> <p>The New Testament Greek equivalent of gophr&icirc;th is θεῖον, or theion, and just like in the Old Testament it&rsquo;s used exactly seven times within the context of God&rsquo;s judgment on wickedness&mdash;a remarkable mathematical coincidence.3 The number seven represents completion, perfection, and veracity, as noted in the seven-day creation week and in Psalm 12:6: &ldquo;The words of the LORD are pure words, like silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.&rdquo; The number seven is even used in reference to God&rsquo;s displeasure of humanity&rsquo;s sinful traits, as stated in Proverbs 6:16: &ldquo;These six things the LORD hates, yes, seven are an abomination to Him.&rdquo; But even more intriguing is that the biblical use of the Greek word theion is essentially the same as the similar word θείο, or the&iacute;o, which means sulphur and can be used interchangeably with the word &ldquo;brimstone.&rdquo;</p> <p>When we put these original biblical terms into the context of the organic compounds that form the structural basis of trees and industrial applications of lumber, the coincidence is remarkable. For all practical purposes, God is speaking a scientific truth to Noah in telling him to use a form of plant material with sulphur-bearing lignin. Furthermore, since the word &ldquo;wood&rdquo; (i.e., &ldquo;tree&rdquo; or &ldquo;timber&rdquo;) in gopher wood is the plural form of the Hebrew ְעץ (&lsquo;&ecirc;ṣ), this fits well with the fact that wooden ships are typically built of many types of hardwood. Some woods work well for the ship&rsquo;s hull, while others are used for support structures, deck planking, and other features&mdash;yet all would be sulphur-bearing tree kinds.</p> <p>Given the great depth of God&rsquo;s wisdom in Scripture, the scientific truth of sulphur-bearing lignified plant tissue yields profound insight into His eternal purposes in judgment and redemption. Noah is also told in Genesis 6:14 to &ldquo;cover [the Ark] inside and outside with pitch.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;cover&rdquo; is the Hebrew word כפָרַ, or k&acirc;phar, which literally means &ldquo;to cover&rdquo; and by extension means &ldquo;to insulate&rdquo; or &ldquo;to atone for (by covering).&rdquo; This word is widely used in Mosaic law to describe the process of the high priest making atonement for the sins of the people (i.e., by covering those sins as if thereby protectively insulating the people), such as on Y&ocirc;m Kipp&ucirc;r (&ldquo;Day of Atonement&rdquo;). An example would be Exodus 30:10: &ldquo;And Aaron shall make atonement upon [the altar&rsquo;s] horns once a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonement.&rdquo;4</p> <p>A related and similar word used for pitch, כפֹרֶ, or k&ocirc;pher, most often describes the &ldquo;covering&rdquo; payment of a ransom for one&rsquo;s life or that of an entire village. In other words, we have the symbolic act of a high priest making atonement for the sins of the people&mdash;insulating and protecting them from judgment. The very materials used in the construction of the Ark not only convey protection from the judgment of the floodwaters but a deeper layer of meaning in the protection against a sulphurous fiery judgment in the afterlife.</p> <p>The deeper we dig into the treasure chest of Scripture, the more nuggets of truth we uncover. Practical biblical truth and profound examples of judgment and redemption can be found throughout Genesis. Both the Ark and Noah serve as foreshadowing types of Christ, and much has been written about them in this respect.4</p> <p>,</p> <p>Even the scientific reality of biblical truth has much to reveal not only about the veracity of God&rsquo;s Word but about the omnipotence and eternal genius of our mighty Creator and Redeemer. Every detail of the Ark&rsquo;s construction shows His care, love, and redemptive purposes.</p>'),

Sometimes the Tanakh comes right out and says that a certain tree or a certain food should be associated with a specific feeling or idea (for example: &ldquo;grapes&rdquo; are associated with: &ldquo;happiness&rdquo;). Other times no indication is given at all.</p> <p>In the Torah, there is a commandment forbidding the Israelites from cooking a young goat in its mother&rsquo;s milk. For some totally unexplained reason, the rabbis have decided to expand this law to include every meat from every animal and every conceivable type of dairy product. That millions of dollars have been, and continue to be, wasted each year enforcing this absolutely ridiculous interpretation of the law has no real relevance to this article.</p> <p>Our purpose here is simply to analyze the law and to attempt to discover the real motive behind this commandment.</p> <p>Basically, there are four elements to the commandment:</p> <p>1) Milk</p> <p>2) Cooking</p> <p>3) A goat</p> <p>4) The mother</p> <p>Okay, so the first element we shall discuss is: &ldquo;milk&rdquo;. In previous articles we have shown that, based on a two-letter root system used in ancient Hebrew, the Hebrew words for: &ldquo;field&rdquo;, &ldquo;a female breast&rdquo; and &ldquo;a spirit&rdquo; are all related. Thus, since &ldquo;a woman&rsquo;s breast produces milk&rdquo;, we can also say that &ldquo;a field produces a type of spiritual knowledge associated with milk&rdquo;. In other articles we noted that, even in modern times, &ldquo;the earth&rdquo; is used as a metaphor for: &ldquo;a school&rdquo; and in any university in the world one can hear the question: &ldquo;What is your field of study?&rdquo;. We went on to conclude that this interpretation was connected to the phrase: &ldquo;A Land of Milk and Honey&rdquo; (We also pointed out that, in the New Testament, the Pharisee Paul of Tarsus comes right out and says that &ldquo;milk&rdquo; is a metaphor for: &ldquo;easy to understand spiritual teachings&rdquo; and &ldquo;meat&rdquo; is a metaphor for: &ldquo;difficult to understand religious teachings&rdquo;).</p> <p>In regards to: &ldquo;the milk&rdquo; produced by the field/breast, all we can say for sure is that it has something to do with: &ldquo;spiritual teachings&rdquo; because of the common root already mentioned. In addition to this, we can also say that the milk of a woman&rsquo;s breast is very tasty, very sweet and very easy to digest. What this then suggests is that: &ldquo;the milk&rdquo; represents: &ldquo;a spiritual knowledge which is agreeable to the listener and is not too difficult to understand&rdquo; (As mentioned in other articles, even in modern times, we still talk about &ldquo;digesting information&rdquo; found in a book or presentation).</p> <p>The second part of the commandment has to do with: &ldquo;cooking&rdquo;. Basically, there are not too many stories in the Torah about cooking, but of the three we shall discuss here, two of them have to do with spices.</p> <p>The first reference we already discussed in a different article and we noted that Potiphar, the man who bought Joseph when he arrived in Egypt, in Hebrew is described as: &ldquo;a chef&rdquo; or: &ldquo;a cook&rdquo; and NOT: &ldquo;Captain of the Guards&rdquo; which appears in most English translations.</p> <p>We also explained that Joseph arrived with a spice caravan and that the Hebrew word for: &ldquo;meat&rdquo; also means: &ldquo;to preach&rdquo;. Our conclusion was that Potiphar took Joseph into his household as a spiritual advisor to help him prepare religious explanations for Pharaoh (i.e. to help &ldquo;spice up&rdquo; his religious sermons).</p> <p>The second story dealing with cooking has to do with Jacob preparing a &ldquo;red food&rdquo; for Esau and exchanging this for his birth right as the first born son. Why this is important is that, as a direct result of this story, Esau&rsquo;s descendants will be known as: &ldquo;The Edomites&rdquo; which means: &ldquo;The Red Men&rdquo; (Thus we could say that as far as Esau is concerned: &ldquo;you really are what you eat&rdquo;).</p> <p>Also, as mentioned in an earlier article, Esau was a hunter (i.e. he chased after meat). What should be considered is that, somewhat surprisingly, the Torah says Esau returns home &ldquo;tired&rdquo;, not hungry, when he makes his deal with Jacob for food.</p> <p>My feeling is that: &ldquo;strength&rdquo; is a metaphor for &ldquo;intellectual strength&rdquo;. Apparently, Esau in his efforts to find a certain type of spiritual knowledge by listening to other religious sermons; reduced his appreciation for the value of being the first born son of Isaac. In other words: by studying the ideas of men, instead of honoring the word of God, Esau&rsquo;s power to understand was diminished, not strengthened (i.e. the new ideas brought confusion and doubt, not clarity)</p> <p>The third reference about cooking also introduces us to the third element of the commandment which is: &ldquo;the goat&rdquo;.</p> <p>What is interesting here is not only does Rebecca cook a spicy or savory stew, but she uses two goats. Hence, our first question must be:</p> <p>Why did Rebecca tell Jacob to bring goats and not lambs or calves?</p> <p>The second question, which we will answer later, is:</p> <p>Why did Rebecca request two goats and not one?</p> <p>To answer the first question we must examine other stories about goats in both the Torah and the Tanakh.</p> <p>One of the most famous stories in the Torah is the betrayal of Joseph by his brothers and selling him into slavery. What is not appreciated is that the brothers, in order to convince their father that Joseph is dead, dip his robe into the blood of a goat. Hence, &ldquo;goat&rsquo;s blood&rdquo; in this story has something to do with: &ldquo;deception&rdquo; and we should keep in mind that God told Noah that: &ldquo;the soul is in the blood&rdquo;.</p> <p>Another story dealing with a goat features the daughter in law of Judah deceiving him into thinking that she is a prostitute. Why this is worth noting is that we are told that Judah was on his way to shear his sheep, so one would think that a prostitute would have asked him for a lamb from his flock. Regardless, once again deception is involved and, in order to accomplish her goal, Tamar specifically asks for a goat.</p> <p>Finally, in the story of Rebecca convincing Jacob to steal Esau&rsquo;s blessing, the entire narrative is based on deception and the goat has a double function:</p> <p>First: the goat is cooked in a special manner, using spices, to make Isaac think that it is some type of meat caught in the field (Once again: it should also be emphasized here that we have repeatedly shown in other articles that: &ldquo;a field&rdquo; is a metaphor for: &ldquo;a school&rdquo; therefore the subject in this story is NOT: &ldquo;real food&rdquo;, but: &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;).</p> <p>Second: the goat&rsquo;s hair is placed on Jacob&rsquo;s arms and shoulders because Esau is described as a man covered with hair as thick as a garment. What, I believe, is significant here is that: &ldquo;hair&rdquo; appears in the stories of Samson and Samuel and is described as being: &ldquo;a sign of one&rsquo;s devotion to God&rdquo;.</p> <p>Thus, in my opinion, these two elements are reflected in the 2nd question we asked about: Why Rebecca requested two goats and not one?</p> <p>Jacob&rsquo;s second son is named: &ldquo;Simon&rdquo; and his name means: &ldquo;to hear&rdquo;. This suggests that Simon is always willing to consider or listen to: &ldquo;two sides of a story&rdquo; or he is always willing to propose, or accept, an alternative view. This is why I believe we are told that Esau is a hunter (i.e. &ldquo;he runs after meat&rdquo;). Esau is associated with &ldquo;the field&rdquo; which we said represents: &ldquo;a school&rdquo;. This combined with chasing after meat suggests that Esau was intellectually curious and was interested in other people&rsquo;s cultures and religions.</p> <p>Thus, Esau is a man with red hair which is described as being similar to goat&rsquo;s hair and we have already touched upon the connection between: &ldquo;hair&rdquo; and &ldquo;devotion&rdquo;. In Hebrew the word for &ldquo;red&rdquo; also means &ldquo;man&rdquo; and &ldquo;ground&rdquo;. Thus, Esau is: a man of: &ldquo;the earth&rdquo; and not &ldquo;a spiritual man&rdquo; since God, traditionally, is associated with the &ldquo;sky/heaven&rdquo; (In Hebrew the words for: &ldquo;sky&rdquo; and &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; are the same).</p> <p>Thus, Esau is devoted to the academic lifestyle based on the teachings of men, however, when compared with the teachings of God, these teachings of men are deceptive in their very nature because men don&rsquo;t know anything for sure (Just as an aside: in the New Testament, The Tetrarch Herod, the descendant of Esau, is described as a person who was very interested in listening to the talks of John the Baptist and Jesus).</p> <p>The fourth part of the commandment has to do with: &ldquo;mothers&rdquo;. A mother is a metaphor for: &ldquo;a spiritual medium&rdquo;. Eve was made from the bone of Adam&rsquo;s rib. The Hebrew word for: &ldquo;bone&rdquo; shares the same two letter root with the word for: &ldquo;adviser&rdquo;. Furthermore, the rib bones produce blood and we already mentioned that God told Noah that: &ldquo;the soul is in the blood&rdquo;. Finally, Adam said that &ldquo;Eve&rdquo; received her name because she is: &ldquo;the mother of all living things&rdquo;. This is clearly a metaphor because Eve is NOT the mother of Adam and she certainly wasn&rsquo;t the mother of the animals.</p> <p>The Hebrew name for &ldquo;Eve&rdquo; means: &ldquo;alive&rdquo; and, even in modern times, there is a connection with a person&rsquo;s ability to understand and life. So, we say a person is: &ldquo;brain dead&rdquo; to suggest that they are: &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; and, in fact, brain activity is the standard now used by hospitals to determine if a person is still living.</p> <p>Thus, &ldquo;a mother&rdquo; is a metaphor for: &ldquo;a source of spiritual understanding&rdquo; given to man by God. In other words: &ldquo;a mother&rdquo; is: &ldquo;a spiritual intermediary&rdquo;. God said it was not &ldquo;good&rdquo; for Adam to be alone. God is always associated with the knowledge about what is good, hence the function of Eve, as a spiritual intermediary, was to help increase Adam&rsquo;s knowledge about God, but instead, initially she helped increase his knowledge about the snake.</p> <p>So then, when we combine our interpretations for: &ldquo;milk&rdquo;, &ldquo;cooking&rdquo;, &ldquo;goat&rdquo; and &ldquo;mother&rdquo;: What do they tell us about the meaning of the commandment?</p> <p>And: How is all this related to eating a cheeseburger?</p> <p>If &ldquo;meat&rdquo; does indeed represent &ldquo;a type of preaching&rdquo;, then: &ldquo;goat&rsquo;s meat&rdquo;<br /> represents: &ldquo;a deceptive sermon&rdquo;. The fact that the commandment specifically mentions: &ldquo;a young&rdquo; goat, suggests that this is: &ldquo;a new idea&rdquo; or &ldquo;a new perspective&rdquo; being presented (i.e. a new form of deception).</p> <p>The fact that it speaks of: &ldquo;a mother&rdquo; implies this is some type of: &ldquo;spiritual teaching&rdquo; about God.</p> <p>The specific food: &ldquo;milk&rdquo; means this teaching is: &ldquo;easy to comprehend or digest&rdquo;.</p> <p>Finally, the fact that the meat is: &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; and does not simply soak in or touch the milk (i.e. like a type of gravy or sauce), suggests that &ldquo;the message has been deliberately altered&rdquo; in some way to make it more appealing and digestible (So in modern times we still use the term: &ldquo;to cook the books&rdquo; when talking about: &ldquo;financial deception&rdquo;)</p> <p>Thus, putting all these elements together we see that the THRICE REPEATED commandment:</p> <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seethe a young goat in its mother&rsquo;s milk&rdquo; actually means:</p> <p>&ldquo;Teachings about God are difficult to understand. Don&rsquo;t accept new spiritual teachings about God that look too good, and too easy, to be true; they have probably been deliberately &lsquo;cooked up&rsquo; to deceive you&rdquo;.</p> <p>And what does all this have to do with eating a cheeseburger? Or: Eating steak and eggs?</p> <p>NOTHING&hellip;.absolutely nothing&hellip;.</p> <p>The rabbis have based their interpretations on the teachings of men utilizing men&rsquo;s logic, NOT the words of God. Therefore, just like Isaac who enjoyed eating Esau&rsquo;s venison, they are blind&hellip;&hellip;</p> <p>And this is the exact same reason why the rabbis also consider the Western Wall in Jerusalem to be a Holy site. A wall that was built by a descendant of Esau; a man who everyone now knows was an ego centric murderer. A man who expanded the temple in order to enhance his own image, NOT to honor God&hellip;.<br /> This evil Edomite&#39;s wall is a Holy site?</p>'),

God will triumph over evil, and evil will be under his feet. HUGE</p> <p>The pronoun used for the &ldquo;seed&rdquo; (zera&lsquo;) of the woman in Gen. 3:15 is, in fact, a singular, subject pronoun (the second type of Hebrew pronoun referred to above). Not only is this type of pronoun, when in the singular, never used with the collective nuance of zera&lsquo;, but conversely, in those verses where zera&lsquo; is the antecedent of a singular, subject pronoun, every one refers to a particular zera&lsquo;, a &ldquo;child&rdquo; (e.g., Gen. 21:13; Lev. 17:12, 21:13, 22:24). Thus, the grammatical/syntactical relationship between the subject, pronoun, and verb in Gen. 3:15 is one that belongs to the so-called counting, rather than collective, sense of zera&lsquo;.</p> <p>It would be akin to saying &ldquo;Jack, he ran up the hill,&rdquo; rather than simply, &ldquo;Jack ran up the hill.&rdquo; In Biblical Hebrew when this phenomenon takes place the desired effect is either emphasis or the removal of potential ambiguity. In this case, because the singular, subject pronoun along with zera&lsquo; is always used to convey the sense of a particular &ldquo;child&rdquo; rather than the collective &ldquo;offspring/descendants,&rdquo; the author is removing ambiguity over how zera&lsquo; should be understood.BIOLA.edu</p> <p>Also worth noting that both of these strikes (a bruising of the heel by a snake-bite and a crushing of the head of the snake) are death blows.

This happens at the cross!</p> <p>Not only is the &quot;seed&quot; singular but the &quot;he&quot; and &quot;you&quot; directly after are also singular in Hebrew.

Whereas her call to reproduce was supposed to be a blessing (Gen. 1:28), now it will be filled with sorrow.</p> <p>Eve&#39;s job of childbearing (Gen. 1:28) will now be filled with toil (Gen. 3:16) and Adam&#39;s job of working (Gen. 2:15) will now be filled with toil (Gen. 3:17-18).</p> <p>You see, the goal of God&#39;s words in Gen. 3:16-19 to Adam and Eve was not to discuss how God is going to make childbirth more painful (Gen. 3:16a), make marriage more difficult (Gen. 3:16b), and make manual labor harder on Adam. Rather, God is saying in Gen. 3:16-19 that their jobs that they were initially given have now been tainted with sin and now life will be filled with sorrow, and will ultimately end in death. Again, why does God only mention childbirth in Genesis 3:16? Are childbirth and marriage the only things that have been cursed by the fall for women? Is everything else untainted? No. He mentions childbirth specifically because he is detailing how something that was supposed to be a blessing will now be filled with sorrow.</p> <p>Eve&rsquo;s desire will be for her &lsquo;man&rsquo;. Many translators translate this as husband (which is its most common meaning of &quot;ishka&quot;), but the word literally means: your man. It is also worth noting that the vast majority of times that Adam is referred to in Genesis 1-3, the Hebrew word used is &ldquo;Adam&rdquo; not &ldquo;ish&rdquo;. So it is certainly possible, that by this usage God is saying not that her desire will be for Adam, but for a future male.</p> <p>This phrase would make almost no sense if we translated it as, &ldquo;Your desire will be for your husband.&rdquo; Was not Eve&rsquo;s desire already for her husband before the fall, and likely much greater and stronger. If anything, the fall likely weakened her desire for her husband. Why would God say this? Also, the second phrase makes no sense, &quot;he will rule over you.&quot; Was Adam not already the leader and Eve the helper (Gen. 2:20)? And are we really saying that men being rulers over women is a curse, when in the New Testament men are to be the &quot;head&quot; of the marriage and the leaders (Eph. 5:22-23;1 Tim. 3:4; 1 Cor. 11:3; 1 Pet. 3:1)? In the New Testament, the headship of the husband seems to be the way God designed things to flourish, not a punishment for women that they have to submit to an unruly dictator in their husband.</p> <p>However, if the translation was for her &lsquo;man&rsquo;, it would make sense, because she is desiring to bring forth this man who will crush the head of the serpent. One other note to bolster this case is her expression in Genesis 4:1, &ldquo;I have brought forth a man, the Lord.&rdquo; Eve was longing for (v. 16b) a man (v. 16b) who would rule over her (v. 16b). The parallels are remarkable and make sense of why she would make this remark in Gen. 4:1.</p> <p>Parallels: Gen. 3:16 - Eve would long for (v. 16b) a man (ish, v. 16b) who would rule over her (v. 16b).</p> <p>Gen. 4:1 - Eve says I have gotten (presumably she was longing for this) a man (ish, 4:1), and she called him Lord (which means ruler).</p> <p>This understanding is supported by two things. 1. She says look I have brought about a &quot;man&quot; (which aligns with the promise of 3:15), she does not say ,&quot;a child&quot; or &quot;a son&quot; (which we would expect), and 2. she calls Cain &quot;Lord&quot; (which means ruler, among other things).</p> <p><strong>Reasons why I think the Messianic interpretation is better:</strong></p> <p>1. It is perfectly literal</p> <p>2. It fits better with the immediate context of Childbearing v. 3:16a</p> <p>3. The other understanding makes no sense.</p> <p>4. It agrees with how Eve understood these words (it explains her response in 4:1)</p> <p>5. The rest of chapters 4-5 is about the seed of Eve. Cain and Abel turn out not to be part of the seed that will crush the serpent so God blesses her with Seth, and he becomes the new center of the story and continuation of the seed.</p> <p>NEW: In the naming of Cain - YHWH, this hasn&#39;t yet been identified as the name of God (Ex. 3:14) but it does mean &quot;Lord&quot; and is translated as kurios over and over again in the septuagint of Genesis. I think Eve may be calling Cain - Lord, the one who would rule over her (see promise in 3:15).</p> <p>SEE - The statement of the woman, &ldquo;I have born a man, YHWH&rdquo; is important. The literal Hebrew has a marker, ֶאת , in front of YHWH and it reads, &ldquo;I have born a man, &ldquo; ֶאת YHWH.&rdquo; This marker is most frequently used as the direct object of the verb, or in apposition, as in naming. This can be seen in the following context as in &ldquo;she again gave birth to his brother, (ֶאת ) Cain.&rdquo; If one simply follows the use of this marker throughout the chapter it is noticed that it prefaces all of the naming done by Eve (Cain in 4:1, Abel in 4:2, Seth in 4:25, as well as Enosh in 4:26). Thus it appears in the immediate context that there is no evidence for making ֶאת (in front of YHWH) different from naming (apposition) in some sense (cf. also 4:17, 18, 20, and 22 for its use before other names). In fact, one has to leave the immediate context to find any use of this Hebrew marker as anything other than a direct object marker or in apposition for naming. THIS IS FROM Biblicalstory.org</p> <p>---------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>The Syriac Peshitta (1st&ndash;2nd cent. CE) offers another important early transla- tion independent of the LXX. It, too, renders תשׁוקה as the equivalent of &ldquo;return&rdquo; in Gen 3:16, 4:7 and Song of Songs.51 Several LXX daughter translations, although less weighty, contain parallel readings that attest to an early and widespread ac- ceptance of the translation &ldquo;return.&rdquo;52 The Old Latin (2nd&ndash;3rd cent.),53 Ethiopic</p> <p>(4th&ndash;5th cent.)54 and Armenian (5th cent.)55 all translate the equivalent of &ldquo;return&rdquo; or &ldquo;turning&rdquo; in Gen 3:16; 4:7 and Song of Songs. The Arabic (9th&ndash;10th cent.) has &ldquo;re- turn&rdquo; in Song of Songs and related words in Gen 3:16 (&ldquo;direction&rdquo;) and 4:7 (&ldquo;mod- eration&rdquo;).56 The Coptic Bohairic version (4th cent.) lacks the Song of Songs text but reads the equivalent of &ldquo;(re)turn&rdquo; in Gen 3:16 and 4:7, and the Coptic Sahidic (4th cent.) lacks Gen 4:7, but reads the equivalent of &ldquo;(re)turn&rdquo; in Gen 3:16 and Song of Songs.57</p> <p>The testimony of these translations corresponds to significant early Jewish writings. In reference to Gen 3:16, the Book of Jubilees (2nd cent. BCE) reads, &ldquo;and to your husband is your return.&rdquo;58 Philo (mid-1st cent. CE) asks, &ldquo;Why does the curse on the woman consist of ... turning (ἐπιστροφή) to her husband ...?&rdquo;59 And Josephus (late 1st cent. CE) plausibly reflects a similar tradition in his use of ἀναστρέφω (&ldquo;overturn, return, associate with someone&rdquo;) in reference to God&rsquo;s confrontation with Cain in Gen 4:6&ndash;7.60</p> <p>The Babylonian Targum Onqelos (1st&ndash;5th cent CE) uses תיובה &ldquo;repentance, reply, return&rdquo;61 in Gen 3:16, and apparently תוב (&ldquo;return,&rdquo; &ldquo;repent&rdquo;) in 4:7.62 The Palestinian Targum Neofiti (1st&ndash;5th cent CE) has &ldquo;to your husband you will turn ,your safety&rdquo;), according to Reuling&ldquo;( רחצונך ,in 3:16.63 The marginal reading &rdquo;)מתב( captures the idea likely implied in the Greek ἀποστροφή.64</p> <p>All of this evidence can be supplemented by the Church Fathers. The writings of Clement of Rome, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Didymus the Blind, Ambrose of Milan,Chrysostom, Augustine, Epiphanius, and Theodoret can be adduced to support Lohr&rsquo;s claim that the Fathers &ldquo;use the equivalent of &lsquo;(re)turn&rsquo; (ἀποστροφή and con- versio) largely without exception.&rdquo;65 The exception in mind is Jerome, whom we will discuss below.</p> <p>CONDREN, JANSON C. &ldquo;Toward a Purge of the Battle of the Sexes and &lsquo;Return&rsquo; for the Original Meaning of Genesis 3:16B.&rdquo; Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 60, no. 2 (June 2017): 227&ndash;45. https://search-ebscohost-com.dts.idm.oclc.org/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=124217370&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site.</p> <p>--------------------------------</p> <p>The text would also like to explain, however, that the man and woman will return to their places of origin.

Adam, following his sin, using his human wisdom invented leaves for clothing. In attempting to approach God through what seemed &ldquo;reasonable,&rdquo; Adam had covered himself, and hopefully his sin, with greenery.</p> <p>Now Cain similarly offers vegetables to establish a relationship with God. Yet Cain is not responding to any revelation of God. The only trace of source is his father&rsquo;s use of vegetables to attempt to continue a relationship to God. Cain follows the serpent by rejecting the revelation of God in 3:15, 21 as to how the relationship should be maintained. In addition, Cain now represents, not only the serpent, but also his father and mother&rsquo;s error, whose source was the serpent. Cain&rsquo;s act, in short, claims righteousness derived from his own depraved mind, his works, normally called &ldquo;self-righteousness.&rdquo;</p> <p>A Sacrifice of Sheep: Following His Father&rsquo;s Desires in 3:21. The only use of animals up this point is for sacrifice as God did in 3:21. There the point was not to clothe Adam and Eve against the elements (there was no need indicated since the weather had not gotten colder nor more foreboding). The specific sacrifice was to illustrate God&rsquo;s provision of The Seed of 3:15 and His unjust death at the hands of the serpent to substitute for their sins.</p> <p>Thus, Abel is raising sheep. There is no other use in the context except for sacrifice and Abel is doing just that. He is acting in accordance with the revelation of God.

Space does not permit me to give a detailed account of all of them, but let me just mention the Gilgamesh Epic.</p> <p>This flood story predates the biblical account and describes the gods bringing a massive flood on humanity. One man and his family survive by building an ark on which he brings animals. At the end of the flood he sends out three birds to check and see if the floodwaters have receded. As soon as he steps out of the ark, he offers a sacrifice.</p> <p>As familiar as this story sounds to those of us who know the biblical account, we also note the differences. The gods send the flood not because of human sin, but because humans make too much noise. One god out of the many gods of Babylon decides to tell his devotee to build an ark. The ark is a big cube! And we could go on.</p> <p>What are we to make of the similarities and differences? The explanation that I think makes most sense is that in the aftermath of an actual devastating flood (in the ancient Near East), the biblical author was inspired (ultimately by God) to write an account modeled on the ancient Near Eastern flood legend in order to make some very important theological points.</p> <p>In the next post, I am going to give a clearer statement of how I read the Flood story, but before I do so, I need to address the elephant in the room.</p> <p>So far I have focused my attention on the biblical text itself, both Genesis 1-11 generally and the flood story specifically.

And in a word, you don&rsquo;t have to know that much about science to understand that there is not a shred of evidence that supports the idea of a global flood. I don&rsquo;t have the space to present the scientific studies that lead to this conclusion, but I can point you to many sources. You might start with the recent posts here about the Grand Canyon. Or look at Davis A. Young, The Biblical Flood: A Case Study of the Church&rsquo;s Response to Extrabiblical Evidence (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1995) or the more recent The Grand Canyon: Monument to an Ancient Earth, edited by C. Hill, et.al., which asks the question &ldquo;Can Noah&rsquo;s Flood Explain the Grand Canyon?&rdquo; and answers with a decided &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Also be on the lookout for article &ldquo;The Genesis Flood and Geology,&rdquo; in the Zondervan Dictionary of Christianity and Science, edited by P. Copan, T. Longman, C. Reese, and M. Strauss, due out in Spring 2017. Here, by the way, the &ldquo;absence of evidence is not evidence of absence&rdquo;; it is significant, even telling.

The word has a wide range of meaning which includes to keep, to guard, to have charge of, to watch over.</p> <p>Now is there any passage of Scripture that applies this word to Moses in his commissioned task of leading Israel? Yes, Hosea 12:13:</p> <p>And by a prophet Yahweh brought Israel out of Egypt and by a prophet he (Israel) was kept (Heb. shamar).</p> <p>This verse is clearly speaking of Moses and describes his commission with the same term as that in our text. In fact, Hosea 12:13 may be directly referencing Ex. 23:20. Here Moses is also called a prophet and we have already established that a prophet is a malak of God. If this text, which we know is referring to Moses, would have instead said, &ldquo;And by a malak Yahweh brought Israel out of Egypt and by a malak he was kept,&rdquo; then every commentator and expositor would claim that God did these things by a supernatural being i.e. an angel, but it would still be referring to Moses.</p> <p>The next thing said about this malak is that he would bring the people to the place God prepared for them, i.e. the promised land. One objection to Moses being the malak is that he did not bring the people into the land. But once again, this is a vacuous argument. Five unambiguous passages establish that this was initially part of Moses&rsquo; assigned task &ndash; Ex. 33:1, 12; Num. 11:12; 27:12-17; Deut. 10:11. It certainly was God&rsquo;s original intention for Moses to bring the people into the land but he was later denied entrance into the land due to dishonoring the Lord at the waters of Meribah {Num. 20:12}.</p> <p>The next thing said about the malak is that the people must &ldquo;take heed before him and listen to his voice.&rdquo; If we look at the narrative leading up to Ex. 23:20-23, we see in Ex. 20 that God spoke to the people directly by audible voice, but the people were afraid and said to Moses, &ldquo;Speak to us yourself and we will obey. But do not have God speak to us or we will die&rdquo; {Ex. 20:19}. In Deut. 5:23-28 we find out that God said that what the people proposed was good. Then God gives a lengthy amount of commands and instructions to Moses, from Ex. 21 -23, which he is to tell the people for God, and 23:20-23 falls within these instructions. Therefore, we should understand Ex. 23:20-23 as God instructing the people that he is sending Moses to lead them to the promised land and that they should obey everything he says since he will be speaking on God&rsquo;s behalf.</p> <p>Next, we read, &ldquo;. . . do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgressions, for my name is in him.&rdquo; This is why the malak cannot just forgive the people if they rebel against him, because to rebel against the malak is to sin against God, not the malak. Exodus 16 illustrates this well. In v.2 it says, &ldquo;The entire Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.&rdquo; Then in v. 7 Moses tells them, &ldquo;in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?&rdquo; In all of these cases Moses is not able to just forgive the people for grumbling against him, because in reality they had rebelled against God, who appointed Moses as his representative before the people. In some cases, when God&rsquo;s judgment had come upon the people, Moses would plead with God to forgive them or had Aaron make atonement for the people, but only God could forgive their rebellion.</p> <p>The first and most obvious objection that might be raised to the proposal that Ex. 23:20-23 is referring to Moses is the fact that Yahweh is speaking to Moses when he says these words. At first glance this seems like a formidable objection but not upon closer scrutiny. While it is true that Yahweh is speaking to Moses, what he is saying is not directed toward Moses but toward the Israelite community.</p> <p>In 21:1 we read:</p> <p>These are the ordinances you are to set before them.</p> <p>Everything written from 21:2 &ndash; 23:33 are God&rsquo;s words which Moses is to relay to the Israelites; God is speaking to the Israelites in the first person. 23: 20-23 falls within this framework and should be understood as Yahweh&rsquo;s words to the Israelites not to Moses. Moses is the one who is to relate Yahweh&rsquo;s words to the people</p> <p>cf. Num. 20:16 and Is. 63:9, people do the same with these passages, as &ldquo;angel.&rdquo; See commentary on those verses. https://letthetruthcomeoutblog.wordpress.com/2023/01/05/exodus-2320-23-who-is-the-angel/?fbclid=IwAR026OOngKlSghXcBUOLxTpvPb_zZSeGSzPS2yUjkvStGg4QMGYIHaH2ESY</p>'),

But this is a rather vacuous objection. Yes, Moses sends the messengers with the specific message but the message is from the perspective of the Israelite people as a whole, not from Moses, as the above underlined portion shows. Therefore, it is Israel who says, &ldquo;we cried out to Yahweh, he heard our cry and sent an agent and brought us out of Egypt.&rdquo; Nothing in this statement, on it&rsquo;s face, would rule out Moses as the agent.</p> <p>Exodus 3:7-12 describes Moses&rsquo; commission:</p> <p>The Lord said, &ldquo;I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt. I have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows. I have come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up from that land to a land that is both good and spacious, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the region of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. And now indeed the cry of the Israelites has come to me, and I have also seen how severely the Egyptians oppress them. So now go, and I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.&rdquo; Moses said to God, &ldquo;Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, or that I should bring the Israelites out of Egypt?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Surely I will be with you, and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: When you bring the people out of Egypt, you and they will serve God on this mountain.&rdquo;</p>'),

The Hebrew reads malak panaw, which literally means a messenger of his face. Because this personage was sent to deliver the people of Israel and not simply bring a message, and because &lsquo;face&rsquo; typically denotes &lsquo;presence&rsquo;, and because there is no definite article in the Hebrew text, we can translate it as an agent of his presence.</p> <p>We have already seen that human agents such as prophets and priests are designated as malak, and that Moses was a prophet and, therefore, can rightly be termed a malak. We have also seen that God commissioned Moses to &ldquo;bring my people out of Egypt&rdquo; {see Ex. 3:10}. Now if someone wants to make the point that there is a difference between &lsquo;bringing&rsquo; the people out of Egypt and &lsquo;delivering&rsquo; them, and that Moses did the former but not the later, then I would turn their attention to Acts 7:35-36:</p> <p>&ldquo;This same Moses&mdash;whom they rejected by saying, &lsquo;Who made you ruler and judge?&rsquo; &mdash;was the man whom God sent to be both their leader and deliverer with the help of the angel who had appeared to him in the bush.&rdquo;</p> <p>The phrase in question is literally &ldquo;an agent of his face.&rdquo; This designation, in all probability, refers to the fact that Moses alone enjoyed a &ldquo;face to face&rdquo; rapport with Yahweh. This is brought out in Ex. 33:7-11, Numbers 7:89, 12:5-8 and Deut. 34:10. Yahweh&rsquo;s presence was associated with the cloud that would appear at the tent of meeting. Moses would go there to speak &lsquo;face to face&rsquo; as it were, with Yahweh. &lsquo;Face to face&rsquo; should not be understood literally but should be taken in the sense of directly, without a dream or vision. Yahweh dispensed with these mediating forms when communicating with Moses and spoke to him directly, with audible voice, from the cloud, which was regarded as his presence. Moses continually stood before the face of Yahweh, i.e. in his presence. This is how Moses can rightly be designated &ldquo;a malak of his presence.&rdquo;</p>'),

It says 100 will be young! this also makes more sense because he just got done saying how there will be no premature death!</p> <p>The only phrase talking about people dying is the last one and its subject is SINNERS not people in the new heavens and earth, therefore, this verse is not saying death will be present in the heavens and earth.</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Johnny&rsquo;s words - There are quite a few reasons why this verse is not saying that death will be present in the New Heavens and Earth. First, let us look at why the greek does not suggest this. To begin, we must not overlook the &ldquo;for&rdquo; (γαρ) conjunction. This conjunction begins v. 20c and tells the reader that he is expanding on a previous thought. What is this previous thought? Well, the author just finished explaining how there shall not be untimely death, or anyone who does not fill out his days. It would be very strange for the author to say that death will be no more, and then to explain how people will die at 100 (as most translations of the hebrew translate this phrase).</p> <p>The second big key in the greek text is the tense of the participle &ldquo;(sinner) who dies&rdquo; and the tense of the verb &ldquo;will be&rdquo;. For some reason many people read this verse 20d as, &ldquo;the sinner will die at 100 years old and will be cursed.&rdquo; Scholars tend to throw the participle into the future. Yet, in the text it is in the present. Now, if you know Koine Greek, you know that the tense of the participle does not speak as much to the timing of the action as the tense of a verb does. However, the most natural way to understand a present participle is something that is occurring right now, not in the future. In this text, Isaiah is saying that the sinner who dies at 100 years old (in this life, presently), will be cursed in the next. He is contrasting the life that many sinners have graciously received with the life that he will give to his saints. He is saying that many sinners have been blessed (undeservingly) with long life here in this life (100 years) but they will be cursed; they will not be so fortunate in the next life. The way we know that Isaiah is no longer referring to saints is because Isaiah changes the referent to &ldquo;sinner&rdquo;. He is saying there will be no more death (v. 20a) in the New Heaven and Earth (for the saint), BUT for the sinner, they will be cursed. He is not saying that there will be death in the New Heavens and earth, because the referent has changed.</p> <p>In v. 20c, Isaiah is saying, &ldquo;You think that living to 100 years is a long time? 100 years in the next life will be considered young! And those that got to enjoy a long life (100 years) in this life, will not get to enjoy eternal life.&rdquo; He is contrasting the two views of life.</p> <p>----------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Anthony Hoekema in his book The Bible and the Future, believe the language is figurative and should be thought of as saying &ldquo;If someone died at 100 they would be thought a mere youth, and if they failed to reach a 100 they would be considered accursed.&rdquo;</p> <p>the eternal new creation context of Isa 65:17&ndash;19 and 65:21&ndash;25 points to the probability that 65:20 is also about the eternal new creation;</p> <p>That there &ldquo;will no longer be [weeping and crying]&rdquo; at the end of verse 19 is the &ldquo;negative counterpart of &lsquo;for ever&rsquo;&rdquo; in verse 18,15 and the &ldquo;no longer&rdquo; that introduces verse 20 is synonymous with the eternal &ldquo;no longer&rdquo; of verse 19, so that it signals that verse 20a&ndash;b at the least, are about eternal realities!</p> <p>Indeed, verse 19 has said that there will never again be &ldquo;weeping&rdquo; and &ldquo;crying,&rdquo; but if verse 20 is affirming the notion of actual death, then there will be &ldquo;weeping&rdquo; and &ldquo;crying&rdquo; over such death in the eternal state introduced in verses 18&ndash;19 and continued with the &ldquo;no longer&rdquo; (which is synonymous with the eternal &ldquo;no longer&rdquo; of v. 19) at the beginning of verse 20.</p> <p>That a reference to Genesis 3 here is fitting is pointed to by the clearer allusion to Gen 3:14&ndash;15 in Isa 65:25, which narrates the curse on the serpent: &ldquo;on your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat &hellip; he [the seed of the woman] shall bruise you [the serpent] on the head.&rdquo; Isaiah 65:25 has, &ldquo;dust shall be the serpent&rsquo;s food. They [including the serpent] shall do no evil or harm on all my holy mountain.&rdquo;25 This refers to the serpent being consummately defeated, so that there will be more harm or evil in the new age (which could not be true of the millennial age).</p> <p>death (see &ldquo;not labor in vain&rdquo; in Isa 65:23a; cf. Gen 3:17&ndash;19) and of the woman&rsquo;s cursed labor pains (Gen 3:16)27 being reversed into a &ldquo;blessing&rdquo; for her &ldquo;seed&rdquo; (Isa 65:23).</p> <p>The following verbal and thematic parallels can be observed between the two passages that cumulatively are unique in all of the OT: (a) the new epoch occurs on a holy &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; (Isa 25:7, 10a and 65:25; cf. Isa 27:13); (b) it will be a time of &ldquo;rejoicing&rdquo; and &ldquo;gladness&rdquo; (using the same Hebrew verbs ילג and שׂמח for these expressions39); (c) God &ldquo;will remove the reproach of his people from all the earth&rdquo; (Isa 25:6) and &ldquo;the former troubles are forgotten&rdquo; and &ldquo;are hid from&rdquo; God&rsquo;s &ldquo;sight&rdquo; (Isa 65:16); (d) it will be a time in which there will be no more crying (Isa 25:8 and 65:19); (e) both speak of the condition of this new era lasting either &ldquo;for all time&rdquo; (Isa 25:8, the time &ldquo;death&rdquo; will be abolished) or &ldquo;forever&rdquo; (e.g. Isa 65:18, the time of &ldquo;rejoicing&rdquo;).</p> <p>Though Isa 65:20 is not a specific development of Isaiah 25, the verses around verse 20 are dependent on Isaiah 25 and its eternal new creational idea</p> <p>In other words, if all youths will die at one hundred or less, then there would be no old men to live out their days. So, even the premillennial literalist must take the phrase about &ldquo;the youth&rdquo; figuratively to some degree or paraphrase it in some sense so it would be harmonious with their view: e.g. &ldquo;some youths will die at the age of a hundred&rdquo; or &ldquo;one would be considered a youth who dies at the age of one hundred&rdquo; (v. 20d).</p>'),

They have failed their calling and have failed God.</p> <p>In 1 Samuel 22, the same thing happens. The sons of Eli sin.

If God has foreseen the revoking of His promise, then His promise was a lie. The more natural reading is that although God raised up Aaron&rsquo;s lineage to be a priest nation, they ignored God&rsquo;s guidance, and God changed His mind based on their actions. God chooses to raise up a new priest:</p> <p>1Sa 2:35 Then I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who shall do according to what is in My heart and in My mind. I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before My anointed forever.</p> <p>The very next chapter starts with God calling to the boy, Samuel. Samuel was called as a boy, not from before birth, and only because of the failings of Eli&rsquo;s sons. But Eli was called young, because God raises up people from birth.

It says that he shall rest, and shall stand in his allotted place at the end of the days. Now, without bringing in any extra theological baggage, does it seem like the end of the days has occurred? No, clearly days are still going. And this would be quite strange to be referring to a different resurrection than the one in Dan. 12:2, because only one resurrection is mentioned in the entirety of scripture (Acts, John 5, Hebrews 9 or 10), besides in Rev. 20:4-6, which I take to be a spiritual resurrection, because it is a visionary passage.</p> <p>Now addressing the two opposing views, the full preterist view and the premillennial dispensational view. First, the full preterist view, they take this resurrection to happen either in 164 BC after the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes, or in 70 AD after the power of the holy people is shattered as Don Preston puts it. The problem of both of these views, is that they simply didn&rsquo;t happen. No multitude of bodies resurrected with both believers and unbelievers. This event is simply not recorded in history. The only bodily resurrection recorded is in the gospels where some believers are resurrected at the death of Jesus. Also, the reason I keep saying bodily resurrection is because an invisible spirit-body resurrection is not resurrection at all. That is important to understand.</p> <p>Next, the premillennial dispensational view. The reason Daniel 12:2 cannot be understood from this viewpoint is that they believe in a large thousand-year gap between the resurrection of believers prior to the millennium (Rev. 20:4-6), and unbelievers after the millennium (Rev. 20:10). Now, to understand this text to refer to anything of that sort is to slaughter the text. It mentions no thousand year gap in between resurrections, and puts them side by side. One resurrection is mentioned here, of believers and unbelievers, to different fates, it is really not that complicated.</p> <p>So, we are not to slaughter the meaning of the text by saying that the resurrection has already happened and we are also not to slaughter it by saying that there is a mysterious 1,000 year gap implied by the word &ldquo;but&rdquo;. Both are to destroy the plain meaning of the text that one resurrection will occur with two destinies.</p>'),

Hag. 2:6&ndash;7; Heb. 12:26&ndash;27) and bring terror to those caught desecrating his holy dwelling.</p> <p>More likely, much of the description of the earthquake, including the mention of Azel, simply refers to details of the historical earthquake during the reign of Uzziah.[2] It is as if the prophet rehearses the details of that past event to say, &ldquo;It will be like that again when the Lord comes to defend his city. His people will have a way of escape.&rdquo; That is certainly the comparison in verse 5: &ldquo;Yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah.&rdquo;</p>'),

So, how are they fleeing from wrath?</p> <p>The context is very helpful here. It seems that the Pharisees and Sadducees were coming to be baptized by John, so that they could be forgiven. The only problem was, these Jews felt that they could receive baptism from John solely because they were Jews, Abraham was their Father (Matt. 3:9). Yet, their actions did not line up with someone who has truly repented (Matt. 3:8), this is why John has such a harsh reaction towards them. They were there, to be forgiven, but not to repent. Therefore, it becomes clear that the Pharisees and Sadducees wanted things from God (salvation and forgiveness) without having the proper heart posture (true repentance) which God requires before forgiving.</p> <p>We also see this recurring theme of the Pharisees unrepentance all throughout the gospel (Matt. 12:34; 23:37), this idea gets repeated and expanded throughout.

He is saying, all blasphemies that you repent of will be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven because by its very nature it puts you beyond repentance. It is the sort of sin that issues from a heart so incorrigibly calloused that a person simply isn&rsquo;t able to repent of it. If a sin makes it impossible for you to repent, then that is an unforgivable sin, because forgiveness is promised only to those sins from which we genuinely repent (cf. 4:12).

So the first verse emphasizes the Son&rsquo;s coming in the Father&rsquo;s glory, while the second emphasizes the Son&rsquo;s coming in his own kingdom authority.</p> <p>Second, in v. 27 we see the universal nature of his coming: he &ldquo;will then repay every man.&rdquo; Thus, all men will be involved in his judgment. This must be understood in terms of Matt. 25:31&ndash;46, a powerful pronouncement (distinctive to Matthew) regarding the Final Judgment (I will be demonstrating this in my forthcoming commentary on Matt. 21&ndash;25). This should also be compared to Matt. 13:36&ndash;43.</p> <p>But in v. 28 the focus is drawn more narrowly. There Jesus limits the reference to &ldquo;some of those who are standing here.&rdquo; This does not imply that only the disciples will witness AD 70, of course. Yet it does show an intentional distinction of audience expectation in Jesus&rsquo; instruction. One audience includes all men, the other only the disciples for his present instructional and exhortational purpose.</p> <p>We are seeing subtle evidences that Jesus is distinguishing his AD 70 (spiritual, metaphorical) coming from his (literal, glorious) Second Coming to effect the Final Judgment.</p> <p>In order to come to an understanding of this saying, we must again be reminded that when Jesus speaks of the &ldquo;coming of the Son of Man,&rdquo; he is purposefully alluding to Daniel 7:13&ndash;14. And again we must recall that the coming of the Son of Man in Daniel 7 is set within a judgment scene before the throne of God (cf. Dan. 7:9&ndash;10). Unlike the saying in Matthew 10:23, the saying in 16:28 is found in the immediate context of words regarding judgment (v. 27). The point that Jesus is making when he says that there are some standing here who will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom is that there are some to whom he is speaking who will not</p> <p>die before the prophecy of Daniel 7 is fulfilled, in other words, before Jesus receives the kingdom from his Father.</p> <p>A comparison of Matthew 16:28 with its parallels in Mark 9:1 and Luke 9:27 lends support to this interpretation. All three sayings are set within the same context immediately before the Transfiguration, yet whereas Matthew speaks of some living long enough to see the coming of the Son of Man, Mark and Luke speak of some living long enough to see the coming of the kingdom of God. The &ldquo;coming of the Son of Man&rdquo; then is simply another way of saying &ldquo;the coming of the kingdom of God.&rdquo; It is the assumption that the words &ldquo;coming of the Son of Man&rdquo; must mean &ldquo;Second Coming&rdquo; that has caused much of the confusion. Once we realize that Jesus is simply using a phrase from Daniel 7 to allude to the whole prophecy, texts such as Matthew 16:28 are much more readily understood. Jesus was not predicting that his Second Coming would occur within the lifetime of some of his hearers. He wasn&rsquo;t speaking of the Second Coming at all.v He was referring to the fulfillment of Daniel 7, his reception of the kingdom from the Father, and this was fulfilled within the lifetime of some of his hearers (cf. Matt. 28:18).vi</p> <p>In several places in the Gospels, Jesus alludes to Dan. 7:13&ndash;14, as he does here. This important Messianic text speaks of the Son of Man&rsquo;s coming to God to receive dominion and a kingdom:</p> <p>I kept looking in the night visions, And behold, with the clouds of heaven One like a Son of Man was coming, And He came up to the Ancient of Days And was presented before Him.

Of course, where Leviticus says that the Jubilee should be proclaimed &quot;throughout the land [of Israel]&quot; (25:10), Jesus said that his messengers must announce the &quot;Gospel Jubilee&quot; to all nations. (</font></font></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>Mt 28:19. Matthew 24:31 may be an &quot;echo&quot; of Isaiah 27:13.) (This is all from: Gideon Thom, <em>Jesus and &quot;the Daniel code&quot;</em>, Acta theol. vol.31 n.2 Bloemfontein Jan. 2011)</p> <p>- From KEN GENTRY</p> <p>The parabolic evidence</p> <p>In Matthew 21:38&ndash;45 the Parable of the Landowner teaches that Israel&rsquo;s religious leaders who condemn Christ will be brought &ldquo;to a wretched end&rdquo; so that the owner of the vineyard can then &ldquo;rent out the vineyard to other vine-growers&rdquo; (Matt 21: 40&ndash;41). Jesus interprets this to Israel&rsquo;s religious authorities: &ldquo;Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and be given to a nation producing the fruit of it&rdquo; (21:43).</p> <p>In Matthew 22:1&ndash;14 the Parable of the Marriage Feast teaches that the gospel was first offered to Israel but that she refused it (22:2&ndash;4). Then when Israel mistreats the gospel messengers &ldquo;the king was enraged and sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and set their city on fire. Then he said to his slaves, &lsquo;The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. Go therefore to the main highways, and as many as you find there, invite to the wedding feast&rsquo;&rdquo; (22:7&ndash;9).</p> <p>The &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; statement</p> <p>So then, through gospel preaching by faithful messengers (&ldquo;angels&rdquo;), God gathers the elect into his kingdom from &ldquo;the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other&rdquo; (Matt 24:31b). In some English versions such as the KJV and NRSV the phrase &ldquo;from one end of the sky to the other&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;from one end of heaven [Gk.: ouranos] to the other&rdquo; (e.g., KJV, NKJV, ESV, NIV, NRSV). This rendering suggests that the elect are being gathered from heaven itself, so that it would seem to require a miraculous, eschatological, supernatural activity.</p> <p>But this use of ouranos does not indicate that the action occurs in heaven above. Note two interpretive clues: (1) This language parallels the preceding phrase: &ldquo;from the four winds&rdquo; (i.e., the four points of the compass). (2) In Scripture such language often signifies simply &ldquo;from horizon to horizon&rdquo; (Deut 30:4; Neh 1:9; cp. Matt 8:11; Luke 13:28&ndash;29).</p> <p>So then, here these two world-encompassing phrases speak of evangelistic success spreading throughout the earth. Consequently, this statement picks up on the theme presented in the parables of the landowner and the marriage feast in Matthew 21 and 22 and anticipates the coming &ldquo;Great Commission&rdquo; (Matt 28:19). These phrases hold forth the promise of the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies, such as Psalm 22:27: &ldquo;All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the Lord, / And all the families of the nations will worship before Thee.&rdquo; And Psalm 2:8: &ldquo;Ask of Me, and I will surely give the nations as Thine inheritance, / And the very ends of the earth as Thy possession&rdquo; (See also: Psa 65:5, 8; 66:4; 67:7; 72:8; 86:9; 98:3; Isa 45:22; 66:23; Mic 5:4; Zeph 9:10).</p> <p>The &ldquo;gathering&rdquo; statement</p> <p>The &ldquo;gathering together&rdquo; is the translation of the Greek episunaxousin which is the future tense of episunago (you will recognize the word &ldquo;synagogue&rdquo; is related to this word). This word only appears three times in Matthew. Besides this use in 24:31 it appears two times in 23:37 where Jesus laments:<br /> O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather [episunagagein] your children together, the way a hen gathers [episunagei] her chicks under her wings, and you were unwilling.</p> <p>Obviously the second usage regarding gathering chicks is intended to illustrate the first. Here Jesus longs to gather disciples to himself from Jerusalem. This gathering of disciples is the same meaning in 24:31.</p>'),

However, that is not the best way to understand this passage for quite a few reasons.</p> <p>First, in the other times the Bible speaks of Jesus getting up from the dead it is the Father, God, who raises Jesus, he does not raise himself. Many verses plainly state that it was God who raised Jesus (cp. Acts 2:32; 4:10; 5:30; Rom. 10:9; 1 Cor. 6:14; Gal. 1:1; 1 Thess. 1:9-10; see commentary on John 10:17).</p> <p>Secondly, since we know Jesus was a man (1 Tim. 2:5) it would be quite strange for him to raise himself from the dead. We would not expect a human to raise themselves from the dead, but God to raise humans from the dead.</p> <p>Thirdly, the word ἀναστῆναι (#450 &ldquo;anastenai&rdquo;) can mean to rise up, raise up, or get up. There is an important disctinction that needs to be made between &ldquo;rise up&rdquo; and &ldquo;raise up.&rdquo; Typically, &ldquo;rise up&rdquo; is used when you (the subject) are rising up, and &ldquo;raise up&rdquo; is used when you (the subject) are raising up something else. Thus, if I am rescued out of a swimming pool my body &ldquo;rose up&rdquo; but I was &ldquo;raised&rdquo; by someone else. Both are true simultaneously, however, &ldquo;rise&rdquo; is from an active perspective and &ldquo;be raised&rdquo; is from a passive perspective. This is important because although this is an active infinitive this does not necessarily mean that Jesus raised himself from the dead (if we were to take the meaning to be &ldquo;raise&rdquo;) but that his body rose (active) from the dead (if we take the meaning to be &ldquo;rise&rdquo;) which is true. Jesus&rsquo; body rose from the dead. Jesus (the subject) rose from the dead. This verse does not tell us the cause, or, who raised Jesus from the dead, but just the result, that Jesus rose.</p> <p>The two parallels, in Matthew 16:21 and Luke 9:22, both use the passive form when talking about Jesus&rsquo; resurrection, &ldquo;be raised up.&rdquo; So, if we know that the parallels speak of Jesus being raised, in other words, someone else is doing the raising, then that should influence how we understand the active infinitive here in Mark 8:31. If both &ldquo;rise up&rdquo; and &ldquo;raise up&rdquo; are perfectly good options, and we know Jesus did not raise himself from the dead, we should understand the phrase to be &ldquo;rise up.&rdquo; Jesus was raised from the dead by the power of God (Acts 2:32, passive sense), and his body did rise (active sense). Both are true.</p> <p>Lastly, the active form of &ldquo;anastemi&rdquo; is used of other humans who certainly do not raise themselves from the dead (Mark 12:23) and carries the meaning of &ldquo;rise&rdquo; instead or &ldquo;raise.&rdquo; Therefore, Mark 8:31 is a remarkable prediction by Jesus that he will rise from the dead three days after he is killed, not that he will raise himself from the dead.</p>'),

Jesus has just finished talking about how we must remove causes to sin because the alternative is to go into the destruction in the fire of Gehenna. So, when Jesus says, after salt has become unsalty, &ldquo;How can you make it salty <em>again</em>?&rdquo; The implied answer is that you cannot. He goes on to say in the parallel in Matthew 5:13 that it is not useful for anything but to be trampled under people&rsquo;s feet. He says this because it is true reality of salt in the real world and it helps communicate a thought that Jesus wanted to communicate about not being able to be restored from the fire of Gehenna.</p> <p>Salt even in modern times in the Middle east, and most likely in ancient times, is obtained from marshes along the sea-shore and is sometimes stored in houses or left on the ground, in both cases it can become ruined, unsalty. William Thomson details a story eerily similar to what we find Jesus describing here in Mark 9:50. &ldquo;These houses have merely earthen floors [i.e., have only dirt floors], and the salt next [to] the ground in a few years [is] entirely spoiled. I saw large quantities of it literally thrown into the street, to be trodden underfoot of men and beasts&rdquo; (W. M. Thompson, The Land and the Book, Baker Book House, Grand Rapids, MI, reprinted 1973. Chap. XXVI, &ldquo;Kersa-Tiberias,&rdquo; Pps. 381-382).

(41, 1, 42, 24, 49, 1, null, 99, null, '<p>Bart Ehrman suggests that this sentence presents one of the biggest contradictions in the gospels. Here Jesus tells his disciples to stay in Jerusalem, yet in Matthew he tells his disciples to meet him in Galilee. What is going on here and is this a contradiction?</p> <p>It is worth mentioning that here in verse 49 it says to wait in Jerusalem until they are clothed with power from on high. Yet in John, this very same day, they are breathed on by Jesus to receive the Holy Spirit, is that not being clothed with power from on high? Plus wouldn&rsquo;t that contradict Jesus telling them to wait if the Spirit was going to give them power that very same day? It would be quite strange of Jesus to say.</p> <p>Firstly, it is important to recognize the distinction between what happened this Sunday and what would happen at Pentecost. I believe, along with Hall Harris&rsquo; Commentary on the Gospel John, that here, &ldquo;Jesus at this point breathed into the disciples the breath of eternal life. This was in the form of the Holy Spirit, who was to indwell them.&rdquo; I also agree with Harris that, &ldquo;This was the giving of life itself, which flowed out from within (cf. 7:38-39). The giving of power would occur later, on the Day of Pentecost.&rdquo; Although the Holy Spirit was given here to the apostles, securing eternal life, the power and gifts of the Spirit given in a unique way and poured out on all people, did not come until Pentecost (Acts 1:8; Luke 24:49). -See commentary on John 20:22 for more information-</p> <p>So, this statement actually aligns quite nicely with John 20:22 in which life is given, yet the disciples are to wait in Jerusalem until power is given to them.</p> <p>Now, let us try to understand what Luke 24:49 is saying. The context is vital in understanding what Jesus means by using the word &ldquo;stay&rdquo;. Does he mean that the disciples cannot leave Jerusalem at all, even for a few days, or is he saying not to leave Jerusalem permanently, until the Day of Pentecost? Well, does the context give us any hints? In verse 47 Jesus has just given a command similar to the Great Commision of Matthew 28. He tells his disciples to preach repentance and forgiveness of sins to ALL NATIONS, beginning in Jerusalem. Are they to begin traveling right now? No. This is why Jesus says what he says in v. 49. He is telling his disciples not to go preach in all the nations until the day of Pentecost happens and they are clothed with power from on high. Therefore, contextually, Jesus is not telling them that they cannot leave Jerusalem at all, even for a little while, to go to Galilee, but rather that they should not leave Jerusalem to preach to the nations (which requires extended periods of time) until the day of Pentecost. Because if they leave too soon, they will miss this extraordinary event, and perhaps miss out on the power given by the Spirit. This is the reason for Jesus command here. It is not to forbid his disciples from traveling to Galilee for a few days, because he commands them to do this in the book of Matthew.</p> <p>Therefore, if the disciples went to Galilee for a few days, as Jesus also instructed, and then came back, they are still following Jesus&rsquo; command here in v. 49, because they did not miss Pentecost.</p>'),

Here are some reasons to understand the prologue as a New Creation passage:</p> <ol type="1"> <li>John 1 uses old creation language but in a different way. Light, darkness, and &ldquo;the beginning&rdquo; are all discussed like in Genesis, but we are to believe in the light (John 1:7; clearly not physical light), and life comes through belief (John 1:12-13) not through birth. Not everyone experiences this life, it is eternal life, not the kind of life in Genesis 1.</li> <li>John would be contradicting the rest of scripture in which God the Father alone created the heavens and the earth (Gen. 1:1; Ex. 20:11; Psa. 33:6, 121:2; Job 38:4), if we were to understand John 1 as teaching that Jesus created all things in the Genesis creation.</li> <li>John the Baptist never bore witness about the light of the old creation, the sun and the moon, but he did bear witness about Jesus (John 1:15) the light (John 1:8). Therefore, we should not understand the light of John 1:4-5 to be the light of the old creation.</li> <li>The statement in John 1:4, &ldquo;that which came to be in it was life, and the life was the light of men,&rdquo; has nothing to do with John 1:3 if it is talking about the Genesis creation of land, sea, sun, and moon. How is the Genesis creation the &lsquo;light of men?&rsquo; It is not clear. However, it is clear that Jesus is the light of of the world. Light and life are directly connected in John 8:12, &ldquo;Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, &ldquo;I am the light of the world. The one who continues to follow me will not ever walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&rdquo;</li> <li>John feels the need to specify that John the Baptist is not the &ldquo;light&rdquo; (John 1:8). If by &ldquo;light&rdquo; he means the sun and moon (the Genesis creation) this statement is nonsensical, of course he is not the sun or moon. However, if by &ldquo;light&rdquo; John has Jesus in mind, it makes sense why he would seek to distinguish the two, by clarifying that John the Baptist is not the True Light.</li> <li>If John 1:1-5 was about the old creation, then there would have to be a 8,000 year gap between John 1:5 and John 1:6. This is highly unlikely considering he continues his thought about light throughout John 1:4-9.</li> <li>John 1:6-7 is clearly about the New Covenant (belief in this light).</li> <li>John 1:12-13 is clearly about the New Covenant (those who receive the true light/word are born from God).</li> <li>The Word or True Light was already flesh in John 1:10-11 when he &ldquo;came to his own&rdquo;. It did not become flesh in John 1:14. The passage is not chronological. Thus, this idea that Jesus pre-existed as a divine being (in John 1:1-13) and then became flesh and was born in John 1:14 simply does not work. Therefore, it would make the most sense to understand the timing of the whole text (John 1:1-18) to be referring to Jesus&rsquo; earthly ministry, or the New Covenant.</li> <li>In John 1:17 the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus. This is even more teaching about the New Covenant, not the Old Covenant or old creation.</li> <li>Since John 1:1 has such close parallels with 1 John 1:1-3, which is talking about the &ldquo;Word of Life&rdquo; that the apostles could touch and feel that was with God &ldquo;from the beginning&rdquo; (1 John 1:1), we should understand the &ldquo;Word&rdquo; that was with God in the beginning of John 1:1 to also be referring to something something that they could touch and feel, a person, Jesus.</li> </ol> <p><strong>&ldquo;In the beginning.&rdquo;</strong> This phrase immediately brings the reader&rsquo;s mind back to Genesis 1:1 in which God created all things &ldquo;In the beginning&rdquo;. Yet, we must ask ourselves is the author, John, trying to give us new insight on Genesis, is he trying to rewrite Genesis and tell us that actually &ldquo;The Word&rdquo; (or Jesus) created the old heavens and earth, as Trinitarians would have us believe? Is this the same &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; as the Genesis 1 creation or is this a different beginning?</p> <p>The Racovian Catechism, one of the great doctrinal works of the Unitarian movement of the 14th and 15th centuries, states that the word &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; in John 1:1 refers to the beginning of the Gospel and thus is similar to Mark 1:1, which starts, &ldquo;The beginning of the Gospel about Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The phrase, &ldquo;in the beginning was the word&rdquo; does not refer to the &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; in Genesis 1:1 (The Racovian Catechism; Reprinted by Spirit &amp; Truth Fellowship, pp. 63 and 64). There is tremendous evidence for understanding &ldquo;the beginning&rdquo; to refer to the beginning of the new creation in Christ.</p> <p>In the rest of the Gospel of John &ldquo;the beginning&rdquo; never means eternity past or the time of the creation of the universe. In the Gospel of John &ldquo;the beginning&rdquo; refers to the life and ministry of Jesus:</p> <ul> <li>&ldquo;For Jesus knew from <strong>the beginning</strong> who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him&rdquo; (John 6:65).</li> <li>&ldquo;So they said to him, &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; Jesus said to them, &lsquo;Just what I have been telling you from <strong>the beginning</strong>&rsquo;&rdquo; (John 8:25).</li> <li>&ldquo;I did not say these things to you from <strong>the beginning</strong>, because I was with you&rdquo; (John 16:4).</li> <li>&ldquo;And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from <strong>the beginning</strong>&rdquo; (John 15:27).</li> </ul> <p>The use of &ldquo;the beginning&rdquo; by the same author in the same book to mean the beginning of Jesus&rsquo;s life and ministry is good reason to understand &ldquo;the beginning&rdquo; in the first verse of his Gospel as a reference likewise to the beginning of the life and ministry of Jesus. Put another way, to interpret &ldquo;the beginning&rdquo; in John 1:1 as a reference to the Genesis creation contradicts how John uses the phrase in all other places in his Gospel.</p> <div class="CxSpFirst" style="text-align:start">&ldquo;The beginning&rdquo; is a phrase used multiple times in the New Testament and most often has the meaning of the beginning of the ministry of Jesus or the beginning of the &ldquo;New Creation.&rdquo; For example, Mark 1:1 says, &ldquo;The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (see also Luke 1:1-2). Also, most convincingly, the same author, John, uses the phrase &ldquo;the beginning&rdquo; at the start of his epistle 1 John, and he means the beginning of the ministry of Jesus. John and his fellow disciples were able to touch, hear, and see the word of life that was &ldquo;from the beginning&rdquo; (1 John 1:1). They did not touch or hear Jesus&rsquo; in his eternal preexistent state, but Jesus in his human body, which they refer to as being &ldquo;from the beginning.&rdquo;</div> <p>Another helpful question to ask to see if this is referring to the Genesis creation or not is: in John 1 what is being created? Is it plants, animals, and the universe like in Genesis 1, or is it new creation concepts, such as eternal life and light? In the Prologue we find that life (John 1:4), light (John 1:4-5), and birth from God (John 1:13) are coming to be through the Word/True Light. In the book of John, life, light, and birth through God come through Jesus. Jesus is &ldquo;the Life&rdquo; in John 14:6, the &ldquo;Light of the World&rdquo; in John 8:12, and people are born again through faith in him in John 3:3. Likewise, it would be quite strange for John to introduce his gospel with the idea that Jesus created the plants, animals and universe (without explicitly mentioning those things) and then to fail to mention this Genesis creation act again in the rest of the book. Thus, it is much more reasonable to conclude that the &ldquo;all things&rdquo; that were created through the Word, or Jesus, are new creation things, because not only are they mentioned in the prologue (John 1:4-5, 13), but also in the book itself (John 3:3, 8:12, 14:6).</p> <div class="CxSpFirst" style="text-align:start"> <p>Noted Bible commentator F.F. Bruce argues for this interpretation:</p> <p>It is not by accident that the Gospel begins with the same phrase as the book of Genesis. In Genesis 1:1, &lsquo;In the beginning&rsquo; introduces the story of the old creation; here it introduces the story of the new creation. In both works of creation the agent is the Word of God. (F.F. Bruce, <em>The Gospel of John</em>, pp. 28 and 29). Thus, it is evident that the vast weight of evidence leans toward understanding &ldquo;in the beginning&rdquo; to refer to the beginning of the ministry of Jesus, or the beginning of the new creation, because of its usage throughout the gospel of John, the New Testament, and its immediate context.</p> <p>So, the question might arise, &ldquo;Why does John use this Genesis language if he didn&rsquo;t have the Genesis creation in mind?&rdquo; John is using this creation language to help us see that this is a new beginning, a new creation that is happening through Jesus Christ (2 Cor. 5:17; Matt. 19:28), and the image brought out by using the words &ldquo;in the beginning,&rdquo; &ldquo;came to be,&rdquo; &ldquo;light,&rdquo; &ldquo;darkness,&rdquo; and &ldquo;life&rdquo; help bring across this idea. However, there are some very notable differences that John uses when describing these concepts that help tell us that this is not the Genesis creation story, but a new creation story.</p> <p>First, there is a battle between the light and the darkness in John 1:5, but the light is victorious. This represents Jesus being victorious over evil through his death and resurrection. Yet, this is much different from the Genesis creation in which God creates physical light in the form of the sun for the day and the moon for the night in Genesis 1:14-19. Second, John the Baptist bears witness about this light, and certainly no one argues that John the Baptist&rsquo;s ministry was about bearing witness to the Sun, rather it was about bearing witness to Jesus (John 1:15). Third, we are to believe in this light (John 1:7), yet, the bible is not teaching us to believe in the Sun, no, we are to believe in Jesus! Fourth, contrary to Genesis 1, people are born in John 1 not through natural processes, but through belief, through trust in Jesus (John 1:12-13). So, as we see, John uses Genesis creation language, but he uses it very differently than Genesis does, and to try to understand these allusions as referring to the Genesis creation misses the point that John is making.</p> <p>For all of these reasons it becomes clear that John is not discussing the Genesis creation at all, instead he is discussing that there is a new world that came to be through Jesus (John 1:10). He is using old creation language in a new way, to describe the new creation coming to be through Jesus Christ. It truly is a beautiful piece of poetry and teaching.</p> <p><strong>&ldquo;the Word.&rdquo;</strong> &ldquo;Word&rdquo; is translated from the Greek word <em>logos</em> (#3056 λόγος). In both Greek literature and Scripture, <em>logos</em> has a very wide range of meanings that fall into two basic categories: one is the mind and products of the mind like &ldquo;reason,&rdquo; (the word &ldquo;logic&rdquo; is ultimately from the root <em>logos</em>), and the other is the expression of that reason in language or life: thus, &ldquo;word,&rdquo; &ldquo;saying,&rdquo; &ldquo;command&rdquo; etc. While it is true that &ldquo;Jesus Christ&rdquo; is not a lexical definition of <em>logos</em>, the &lsquo;new creation&rsquo; perspective is not saying that <em>logos</em> <em>means</em> Jesus, but that it <em>refers</em> to Jesus. &ldquo;The Word&rdquo; is a metaphor being used to represent Jesus Christ because Jesus is the expression (Word) of God, just like the serpent is a metaphor for Satan, but Satan is not a literal snake. Satan does not mean snake, it means adversary, but in the same way, &ldquo;the word&rdquo; does not mean Jesus, but it is being used to refer to Jesus.</p> <p>There are quite a few reasons why &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; here in John 1:1-3 should be understood as referring to Jesus.</p> <ol type="1"> <li>Life (John 14:6), light (John 8:12), and new birth (John 3:3) all happen through Jesus in the gospel of John, in the Prologue of John, life, light and new birth all happen through the Word.</li> <li>Jesus is &lsquo;Word of Life&rsquo; in 1 John 1:1, so it would make the most sense to understand him as &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; that creates life here in John 1. It is the same author beginning his book in both places.</li> <li>Jesus is the True light of John 1:9-13 &ldquo;through whom the world comes to be,&rdquo; and who comes to his own people, so because of the almost identical wording in John 1:1-3, it is best to believe that he is also the Word &ldquo;through whom everything comes to be.&rdquo; The language of the two phrases is almost identical and unmistakable, with πάντα διʼ αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο &ldquo;Everything came to be through it/him&rdquo; (John 1:3) vs. ὁ κόσμος διʼ αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο &ldquo;the world came to be through it/him&rdquo; (John 1:10). Also, in John&rsquo;s flow of thought, that which comes to be through the Word is the light of humankind (John 1:4), and similarly, the true light gives light to every person (John 1:9), so it seems that &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; and the &ldquo;true light&rdquo; are both referring to the same thing, Jesus.</li> <li>A title for Jesus that John uses is &ldquo;the Word of God&rdquo; (Rev. 19:13) so it would not be out of the ordinary at all for John to use &ldquo;the word&rdquo; to refer to Jesus.</li> <li>In John 1:14 we are told that the Word became flesh. This is another reason why it makes sense to view &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; as a reference to Jesus. <ul> <li>This verse does not say, &ldquo;God became flesh,&rdquo; or that &ldquo;Jesus became flesh,&rdquo; nor does it mean that Jesus or God became flesh. Rather, it means that the Word (the expression of God) became flesh, in other words, God was not expressed through spoken word like in the Genesis creation, but through a man of flesh, Jesus. [For more information, see the commentary on John 1:14].</li> </ul> </li> <li>The flow of thought does not work in John 1:1-5 if we take &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; to be a reference to the Genesis creation. This &ldquo;light&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Word&rdquo; is victorious over the darkness and John the Baptist testifies about this &ldquo;light.&rdquo; John the Baptist does not testify about the Sun or Moon, but about Jesus who is the Light of the World (John 8:12).</li> <li>The Word was <em>with</em> God in John 1:1, and in John 1:18, Jesus is in a most intimate relationship with the Father, he was with God.</li> <li>In John 1:18 John says that Jesus &ldquo;explains&rdquo; the father, words are used for explanation, thus, one can see the metaphor John would be making by calling Jesus the &ldquo;Word&rdquo; of John 1:1, the explanation of God.</li> <li><strong>In Col. 1:16 &ldquo;all things&rdquo; (in reference to &ldquo;all things&rdquo; in the new creation) are created through Jesus, here in John 1:3, &ldquo;all things&rdquo; are created through the Word, this is another reason to understand the Word as referring to Jesus.</strong></li> </ol> <p>Therefore, &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; is a metaphor used for Jesus in John 1:1-3.</p> <p>There are two reasons we can derive from the immediate context as to why John would use the particular metaphor of the &ldquo;Word&rdquo; for Jesus instead of something else. Firstly, because Jesus is the perfect word, expression, or message of who God is. It is taught that Jesus expresses God in the Prologue (John 1:18), in the book of John (John 8:19), and in the New Testament (Heb. 1:3). Throughout John&rsquo;s gospel we see Jesus teaching that he himself expresses God to us: &ldquo;If you knew me, you would know my father,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;if you have seen me, you have seen the Father&rdquo; (John 8:19, 14:9). The second reason John likely used the &ldquo;Word&rdquo; as a metaphor for Jesus was to illustrate that Jesus is the means by which God created the new creation (John 1:3, 10), just as God&rsquo;s spoken word was the means by which he created the Genesis creation. Jesus is the perfect expression (<em>logos</em>) of God. God creates through his word in the Old and he is creating through his word (Jesus) in the New. His &ldquo;word&rdquo; just looks much different in the New.</p> <p><strong>&ldquo;the Word was with God.&rdquo;</strong> This phrase is absolutely vital and should not be ignored when interpreting John 1. Many Trinitarians gloss over this phrase and focus on John 1:1c supposedly calling &ldquo;the Word,&rdquo; God. However, this runs into many problems.</p> <p>In the phrase &ldquo;the Word was with God,&rdquo; Trinitarians understand &ldquo;God&rdquo; to mean Father; that Jesus was with the Father. However, when they arrive at the third phrase they say, &ldquo;Look, Jesus is called God!&rdquo; Yet, right before, God means the Father, so are we claiming that the Son is the Father? No, clearly this is problematic. Well, the Trinitarian might respond that &ldquo;God&rdquo; means the Trinity in 1:1c, however, that does not work either because this would be the logic: Son = Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Jesus is not the Trinity, in Trinitarian theology, he is part of the Trinity. Therefore, this passage actually does not teach the modern definition of the Trinity at all, and must be interpreted quite strangely in the Trinitarian framework, changing the meaning of &ldquo;God&rdquo; throughout the sentence.</p> <p>What John simply means in this phrase is that Jesus was close with God here on earth in his body. He had intimate fellowship with the God of the universe. John further elaborates upon John 1:1 later in John 1:18. He says, that Jesus &ldquo;is in a most intimate relationship withe the Father.&rdquo; Jesus had the full presence of God&rsquo;s Spirit (Luke 4:1), and he called God his own Father (John 5:18). He was one with (John 10:30, 17:22), or united with God. Thus, the context helps bring to light what John meant by his phrase &ldquo;the Word was with God.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>&ldquo;what God was the Word was.&rdquo;</strong> The final big question of John 1:1 is, does John 1:1c explictly call &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; God? For this question it is helpful to consult the Greek. In the Greek there is an interesting construction of this phrase that is not apparent in many english translations. In John 1:1b the Greek word for God (<em>theos</em>) has an article in front of it. Yet in John 1:1c &ldquo;and the Word was God,&rdquo; there is no article in front of God. Interestingly, John picks back up the article in verse 2. Now we must ask, why would John drop the article particularly in this usage in John 1:1c?</p> <p>Daniel Wallace, a renowned Greek Scholar admits that John 1:1c is likely a qualitative use of &ldquo;<em>theos</em>.&rdquo; He cites that grammatically, the largest proportion of pre-verbal anarthrous predicate nominatives (PAPN) fall into this category (Wallace, <em>BBG</em>, 269). In other words, in a Greek construction like we have here in John 1:1c, the noun &ldquo;<em>theos</em>&rdquo; is usually qualitative. The most natural meaning of the word would be that it referred to the quality of God, i.e., &ldquo;divine,&rdquo; &ldquo;god-like,&rdquo; or &ldquo;like God.&rdquo; The New English Bible gets the sense of this phrase by translating it, &ldquo;What God was, the Word was.&rdquo; James Moffatt, who was a professor of Greek and New Testament Exegesis at Mansfield College in Oxford, England, and author of the well-known Moffatt Bible, translated the phrase, &ldquo;the <em>logos</em> was divine.&rdquo; There are 53 uses of PAPN&rsquo;s in the book of John similar to what we have here in John 1:1c and Philip Harner in his article <em>Qualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns</em>, says, &ldquo;In 40 of these cases the qualitative force of the predicate is more prominent than its definiteness or indefiniteness&rdquo; (p. 83). Thus, we have great reason to conclude that John dropped the article in John 1:1c to communicate that the Word had the qualities of God, he was godly, like-God, or divine, but was not God himself.</p> <p>Now, the problem with the typical Trinitarian translation is quite significant. Even Dan Wallace points this out. If we say that John 1:1c is definite, then it would be a convertible proposition with <em>logos</em> (i.e. the Word = God). The problem with this argument is that &ldquo;<em>theos</em>&rdquo; in John 1:1b is the Father (the Word was with God). Thus to say that &ldquo;<em>theos</em>&rdquo; in 1:1c is the same person is to say that the Word was the Father. This is a form of sabellianism or modalism, (Wallace, 268) both heresies according to most evangelical Trinitarians. So, this verse is actually not clear support for Trinitarianism at all. One would have to change the meaning of God from 1:1b to 1:1c, &ldquo;the Word was with God (the Father), and the Word was God (part of the Trinity)&rdquo;, which is a very unnatural reading of the text.</p> <p>Thus, Jesus is not called &ldquo;God&rdquo; in John 1:1, but Jesus (the Word) has the qualities of God. This is absolutely affirmed throughout the New Testament, as Jesus is perfectly loving, patient, and kind like the Father, and Jesus even goes so far as to say that if you see him you have seen the Father (John 14:9).</p> <hr /> <p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Problems with Logos Christology:</span></p> <ol type="1"> <li>You have to figure out how John the Baptist bears witness to the light of the old creation.

How is the old creation life, light?</li> <li>You have to figure out when the Word, the plan or purpose of God, switches from being a concept to a person, because it is certainly a person in v. 10. And since there is such continuity in his whole train of thought in the prologue, this is tough.</li> <li>You have to figure out how to reconcile v. 14 with v. 10. If v. 14 is when the plan becomes flesh, what is happening in v. 10? If the prologue is not chronological, which v. 10 suggests, then the support for a chronological reading (which logos christology relies on) falls apart.</li> <li>You have to figure out how God creating the old heavens and earth through his Word helps introduce us to Jesus of Nazareth. Why spend so much time on this?</li> <li>In v. 10 the world &ldquo;came to be&rdquo; through the &ldquo;light&rdquo;. What does this have to do with Jesus? The light never becomes flesh, only the Word becomes flesh. So, why say this? This seems quite peculiar, unless, it is a metaphor about Jesus.</li> </ol> </div>'),

Interestingly, as is pointed out by Andrew Perry,<strong>[fn]</strong> John also uses ουτος to refer to John the Baptist in v. 7, &ldquo;this <em>one</em>&rdquo; (typically translated &ldquo;this <em>man</em>&rdquo;) came to bear witness about the light (John 1:7), whereas in John 1:2, it says, &ldquo;this <em>one</em>&rdquo; (typically translated &ldquo;this <em>Word</em>&rdquo;) was in the beginning with God. John is likely contrasting the life and ministry of Jesus, with the life and ministry of John the Baptist. Whether or not John is making this contrast between Jesus and John the Baptist here in John 1:2, at the very least, John is specifying that he has one particular &ldquo;Word&rdquo; in mind.</p> <p>John is using &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; as a metaphor for Jesus. In other words, when we read &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; we should think &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; and that the &ldquo;all things&rdquo; coming to be through &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; are coming to be through Jesus.

Very often in scripture &ldquo;all&rdquo; is used, and does not mean every possible thing but everything in a category. [See commentary on John 21:17 for how the scriptures use &ldquo;all&rdquo;]</p> <p>So, the question remains, is this talking about how everything came to be through God&rsquo;s spoken Word in Genesis, or how everything in the New Creation came to be through Jesus? Does the passage specify what the &ldquo;all&rdquo; things are? Are they plants, animals, and the ocean? Or is it something else? John tells us, &ldquo;that which came to be through it was &ldquo;life&rdquo; (John 1:4). Yet, in context, this &ldquo;life&rdquo; is not genesis life that comes through birth, but it is life that comes through belief (John 1:12-13).</p> <p>The following are reasons that John 1:3-4 is a new creation passage [For more discussion on this, see commentary on John 1:1]:</p> <ol type="1"> <li>It fits better with the immediate context. The &ldquo;light&rdquo; of John 1:4-9 is one continued thought, of which John the Baptist bears witness. He did not bear witness about the old creation light, but the new creation light (Jesus, the light of the world). John bore witness of Jesus (John 1:15) the light (John 1:8). Therefore, we should not understand the light of John 1:4-5 to be the light of the old creation.</li> <li>The statement in John 1:4, &ldquo;that which came to be in it was life, and the life was the light of men,&rdquo; has nothing to do with John 1:3 if it is talking about the Genesis creation of land, sea, sun, and moon. How is the Genesis creation the &lsquo;light of men?&rsquo; It is not clear. However, it is clear that Jesus is the light of the world, and that he is the light of men. Light and life are directly connected in John 8:12, &ldquo;Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, &ldquo;I am the light of the world. The one who continues to follow me will not ever walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&rdquo;</li> <li>John 1 uses old creation language but in a different way. Light, darkness, and the beginning are all discussed like in Genesis, but we are to believe in the light (John 1:7; clearly not physical light), and life comes through belief (John 1:12-13) not through birth. Not everyone experiences this life, it is eternal life, not the kind of life in Genesis 1.</li> <li>John would be contradicting the rest of scripture in which God the Father alone created the heavens and the earth (Gen. 1:1; Ex. 20:11; Psa. 33:6, 121:2; Job 38:4), if we were to understand John 1 as teaching that Jesus created all things in the Genesis creation.</li> <li>John feels the need to specify that John the Baptist is not the &ldquo;light&rdquo; (John 1:8). If by &ldquo;light&rdquo; he means the sun and moon (the Genesis creation) this statement is nonsensical, of course he is not the sun or moon. However, if by &ldquo;light&rdquo; John has Jesus in mind, it makes sense why he would seek to distinguish the two, clarifying that John the Baptist is not the True Light.</li> <li>If John 1:1-5 was about the old creation, then there would have to be a 8,000 year gap between John 1:5 and John 1:6. This is highly unlikely considering he continues his thought about light throughout John 1:4-9.</li> <li>John 1:6-7 is clearly about the New Covenant (belief in this light).</li> <li>John 1:12-13 is clearly about the New Covenant (those who receive the true light/word are born from God).</li> <li>The Word was already flesh in John 1:10-11 when he &ldquo;came to his own&rdquo;. It did not become flesh in John 1:14. So this idea that Jesus pre-existed as a divine being (in John 1:1-13) and then became flesh and was born in John 1:14 is simply not found in the text. Therefore, it would make the most sense to understand the timing of the whole text (John 1:1-18) to be referring to Jesus&rsquo; earthly ministry.</li> <li>In John 1:17 the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus. This is even more teaching about the New Covenant, not the Old Covenant or old creation.</li> </ol> <p>This Prologue is an introduction to the book. Therefore, we would expect to see the things that he introduced be explained further in the book. If this is talking about Jesus creating the planet earth, or even &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; creating planet earth, why is this not further discussed in the book of John? However, we see new life, or eternal life, come through Jesus in John 14:6 and many other places in the book (John 3:16, 6:47-48, 10:28, 17:3). This new life coming through Jesus is a theme in John 3, and in the entire book of John. However, the Genesis creation coming through Jesus is absent from the book of John and from the New Testament. In fact Jesus himself says, &ldquo;from the beginning, &lsquo;God made them male and female&rsquo;&rdquo; (Mark 10:6). Therefore, Jesus himself attributes the Genesis creation to someone else other than himself, namely, God.</p> <p>It is also worth noting that &ldquo;all things&rdquo; (<em>panta</em>) is used in reference to &ldquo;all things&rdquo; in the new creation many times in the New Testament (Col. 1:20; 2 Cor. 5:18; Rom. 11:36; Heb. 2:10; Heb. 1:2; Col. 1:16; Matt. 11:27; John 17:7; 3:35; 13:3; 1 Cor. 15:27; Eph. 1:22; 3:9). For instance, &ldquo;through him (Jesus) God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things&rdquo; (Col. 1:20). This cannot mean &ldquo;all things&rdquo; in totality, but all things that are part of the new creation, since unreconciled people are not part of &ldquo;all things&rdquo; reconciled to God. Likewise, when 1 Corinthians 15:27 says, &ldquo;For he has put all things in subjection under his feet,&rdquo; this does not include the enemies that will be destroyed (1 Cor. 15:25-26), but &ldquo;all things&rdquo; in the new creation. Therefore, simply saying &ldquo;everything&rdquo; or &ldquo;all things&rdquo; (<em>panta</em>) without specifying that it is everything in the new creation, is not out of the ordinary, and that is exactly what the author John is doing here in John 1:3.</p> <p>&ldquo;All&rdquo; came to be through the Word (John 1:3). &ldquo;All&rdquo; what?

This means that by verse 10 one must understand the &ldquo;true light&rdquo; to not be referring to a literal light, or else it would be neuter, but instead John uses the masculine without introducing a new subject. Thus, John must have something in mind besides literal light, and since John the Baptist bears witness about this light (John 1:7-8), and in the very same passage he bears witness about Jesus (John 1:15), it follows that Jesus is the true light (John 1:9).</p> <p>Even more evidence that this light is in reference to Jesus is found in verse 12, &ldquo;those who believe in his (the true light&rsquo;s) name&mdash;he gave the right to become children of God,&rdquo; and in the book of John itself, John speaks of belief in Jesus as the way by which new birth happens (John 3:15-16).</p> <p>In John 3:19 we find John clearly using light as a metaphor for Jesus when he says, &ldquo;the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light,&rdquo; when just a few verses prior he says that God sent his Son into the world (John 3:17). This light/darkness metaphor in John 3:19 is referring to the concept of salvation and evil people rejecting Jesus as the Messiah. It is not in reference to men being opposed to the brightness of the Sun. John is clearly making a spiritual point not a physical one. He is doing a very similar thing in John 1:5.</p> <p>Another reason why we should understand &ldquo;light&rdquo; to be a metaphor for Jesus in John 1:5 is because Jesus himself claims to be the &ldquo;light of the world&rdquo; (John 8:12). Therefore, it is evident that in the book of John, &ldquo;light&rdquo; is consistently used in reference to Jesus and his ministry.</p> <p>Lastly, John also uses very similar language in 1 John 2:8 when discussing the New Covenant ministry of Jesus, &ldquo;On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you because the darkness is passing away and the true light already shines&rdquo; (1 John 2:8). <strong>[fn][Bernard, J.

If John was referring to the literal Sun, what would he mean by, &ldquo;the darkness did not overcome it?&rdquo; However, this statement would make sense if it was referring to Jesus&rsquo; accomplishment of defeating the Devil, sin, and death, through his atoning sacrifice. Jesus was victorious, he defeated death (1 Cor. 15:55-57; Rom. 6:9; Heb. 2:14; 2 Tim. 1:10), and the powers of sin (John 8:36) through his death and resurrection. In fact, before his resurrection, Jesus speaks of his future victory over sin and death as if it has already been accomplished, saying, &ldquo;Take heart, I have overcome the world&rdquo; (John 16:33).

In John&rsquo;s mind, he felt it relevant to begin talking about John the Baptist directly after mentioning the light and darkness of some creation. Yet, if John 1:4 is referring to the literal light and darkness created in the Genesis creation, then his mentioning of John the Baptist makes no sense. What does John the Baptist have to do with the Genesis creation? However, if the author John has in mind the New Creation through Christ, the light, then introducing John the Baptist is quite essential, as he is the one who prepares the way for Jesus, and testifies to him (John 1:7-8). It is also noteworthy that all of the gospels mention John the Baptist as preparing the way for Jesus (Matt. 3; Mark 1; Luke 1). Therefore, instead of creating at least a 8,000 year gap between John 1:4 and John 1:5, we should understand both to be referring to the New Creation. In fact, John the Baptist bears witness about the light of John 1:4, so, the author John sees great continuity of thought between John 1:4-9.</p> <p>Secondly, the phrase &ldquo;sent from God&rdquo; is a phrase that is used of Jesus quite often (John 3:16; 5:23; Luke 10:16). Many Trinitarians take this to mean that Jesus pre-existed with God in some unkown state and then became a human in the man Jesus. However, as is seen here, to say that someone is sent from God, does not imply pre-existence, instead, it simply means that God has given them a mission to accomplish. &ldquo;Frequent reference is made in the OT to prophets being sent by God (2 Chr. 24:19; 25:15; Jer. 7:25; 25:4, 5; 28:9; 35:15; 44:4; Baruch 1:21).&rdquo; <strong>[fn][Colin G. Kruse, John: An Introduction and Commentary, vol. 4, Tyndale New Testament Commentaries (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2003), 65.]</strong> In the same way, disciples are sent by Jesus to preach the gospel into the whole world (Matt. 28:18-19), and to his apostles Jesus said, &ldquo;As the Father has sent me, even so I send you&rdquo; (John 20:21). Therefore, it is evident that this &ldquo;sending&rdquo; language is used very often and does not inherently carry the idea of pre-existence.</p> <p>[For more information on why John 1 speaks of the New Creation, not the Genesis creation, see our commentary on John 1:1]</p>'),

John the Baptist, the subject here, testified about Jesus and his ministry (John 1:15), never once did he testify about the Sun and Moon of the Genesis creation. Therefore, the &ldquo;light&rdquo; is in reference to Jesus the True light (John 1:9) and the &ldquo;light of the world&rdquo; (John 8:12). [For more discussion on the &ldquo;light&rdquo; see our commentary on John 1:5]</p> <p>The same light that came through the Word &ldquo;in the beginning&rdquo; is the same light that John the Baptist testifies about. Therefore, whatever &ldquo;the beginning&rdquo; was in verse 1 is around the same time frame as verse 6. There is no gap of thousands of years between &ldquo;the beginning&rdquo; and John the Baptist. To disconnect the light in verse 4 by thousands of years from the light that John is bearing witness about in verse 5 is unwarranted.</p> <p>Therefore, when reading John 1 through a Trinitarian lens, one misses this beautiful analogy that Jesus is the light of the New Creation.

The &ldquo;light&rdquo; John is speaking of is not a light one sees, but a light one believes in. If one believes in this light, he is born (John 1:13), yet we know that physical birth does not happen through belief, therefore, this must be a different kind of birth. John is speaking of the New Birth which Jesus further discusses with Nicodemus in Chapter 3.

In other words, the last phrase must read, &ldquo;yet the world did not know him,&rdquo; and since, translating the sentence &ldquo;It was in the world, and the world came to be through it, yet the world did not know him,&rdquo; does not make sense contextually (because it would introduce two subjects), we have translated the subject as &ldquo;he&rdquo; consistently throughout the verse. The reason the author John uses a masculine pronoun in this verse is to communicate that he does not just have in mind a concept (the True Light) but a person (Jesus).</p> <p>Also, notice the order of the phrases here in John 1:10. John says that Jesus was &ldquo;in the world,&rdquo; then he says that &ldquo;the world came to be through him.&rdquo; If John had the Genesis creation in mind, this is the opposite order of what you would expect. The Genesis creation happened thousands or millions of years before Jesus was in the world. In this scenario, one would expect John to say something along the lines of, &lsquo;the world came to be through him, and <em>then</em> he came into the world.&rsquo; Perhaps John does not have the Genesis creation in mind, but that the world <em>to come</em> came to be through him, and this happened after Jesus&rsquo; resurrection, after his time &ldquo;in the world.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>&ldquo;the world came to be through him.&rdquo;</strong> There are a few possible interpretations of what this phrase means. First is the common Trinitarian understanding, that &ldquo;the world&rdquo; is in reference to the Genesis creation and this came to be through Jesus. This view would be understood as, &ldquo;the <em>old</em> world came to be through him.&rdquo; However, this Trinitarian understanding is not as fitting for multiple reasons:</p> <ol type="1"> <li>If John meant here in John 1:10b that Jesus created the material creation, then he is rewriting Genesis 1 and the other places in which God the Father is the only creator of heaven and earth (Gen. 1:1; Psa. 121:2; Job 38:4; Mark 10:6).</li> <li>John never discusses Jesus&rsquo; creation of the universe again in the gospel of John. If a Prologue is meant to introduce the gospel account then John introduces something that never comes up again. What does come up again regularly is the new creation of the world: sinners being &ldquo;born&rdquo; again (John 3), and eternal life, or new life, coming through Jesus (John 3:16; 6:33; 14:6).</li> <li>The immediate context before and after John 1:10 discusses belief and life (John 1:4-8; 11-13) not the creation of Genesis.</li> </ol> <p>Therefore, to understand this as the creation of the old heavens and the earth does not fit with the immediate or broad context.</p> <p>[Please see our New Creation commentary on John 1:1 to see why this perspective is not the best way to understand John&rsquo;s words.]</p> <p>Secondly, one could understand this phrase to mean that &ldquo;the world <em>was born</em> through him.&rdquo; Although &ldquo;was born&rdquo; is a possible way to understand the Greek word <em>egeneto</em> (#1096, ἐγένετο), and the &ldquo;world&rdquo; would keep a more consistent meaning throughout John 1:10 (it would mean the &ldquo;unbelieving&rdquo; world in both John 1:10b and 1:10c), and &ldquo;<em>unbelieving</em> world&rdquo; is a very common way John uses <em>kosmos</em> in his gospel (John 7:7; 12:19; 15:18; etc.), this perspective has a few negatives. Firstly, <em>egeneto</em> more often takes the meaning of something &ldquo;coming to be&rdquo; or &ldquo;happening&rdquo; (<em>BDAG</em>, p. 196), and it is used this way by John predominantly throughout the Prologue (John 1:3, 6, 14, 17). Also, John uses a different Greek word <em>egennēthē</em><em>san</em> (#1080, ἐγεννήθησαν) in John 1:13 to communicate the idea of birth. So, if John had meant to communicate that the &ldquo;<em>old</em> world <em>was born</em>&rdquo; through him, he more likely would have used <em>egennēthē</em><em>san.</em> Moreover, since this phrase has extremely strong syntactic parallels with John 1:3, it is unlikely that <em>egeneto</em> in John 1:3 meant to communicate &ldquo;coming to be&rdquo; whereas <em>egeneto</em> in John 1:10 meant to communicate &ldquo;birth.&rdquo; Therefore, it is unlikely that John meant to communicate that &ldquo;the <em>old</em> world <em>was born</em> (came to new life) through him.&rdquo; Although, the theology is certainly true, this is not likely what John was trying to communicate in John 1:10b.</p> <p>The last way to understand this phrase is that the &ldquo;world <em>to come</em> came to be through him.&rdquo; In other words, the new creation came to be through Jesus. The first reason for understanding this phrase in this way is the strong parallel with John 1:3. In whatever way we interpret John 1:3, this should influence how we interpret John 1:10b because the syntax is almost identical. In John 1:3 we read, &ldquo;Everything came to be through it (the Word),&rdquo; and in John 1:10b we read, &ldquo;the world came to be through him.&rdquo; Since, the &ldquo;everything&rdquo; of John 1:3 is everything in the New Creation (see commentary on John 1:3), it would make sense to understand the &ldquo;world&rdquo; of John 1:10b to be the &ldquo;world <em>to come.</em>&rdquo;</p> <p>Secondly, in the book of John, Jesus uses the term &ldquo;world,&rdquo; or <em>kosmos</em>, in a way that implies his Kingdom is of &ldquo;another&rdquo; world.</p> <ul> <li>&ldquo;Whoever is overly attached to his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in <strong>this world</strong> will keep it, resulting in life in the age to come&rdquo; (John 12:25). Some translations read, &ldquo;will keep it for eternal life&rdquo; (ESV). This verse is especially powerful because Jesus is contrasting &ldquo;this world&rdquo; with &ldquo;life in the age to come,&rdquo; or &ldquo;eternal life,&rdquo; which are in the <em>next</em> world. In other words, whoever hates his life in this world will keep it <em>in the world to come,</em> is the implied ellipsis.</li> <li>&ldquo;My kingdom is <strong>not of this world</strong>. If my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews, but in fact, my kingdom is not from here&rdquo; (John 18:36).</li> <li>&ldquo;You are from beneath, I am from above. You are of this world, I am <strong>not of this world</strong>&rdquo; (John 8:23).</li> <li>&ldquo;They are <strong>not of the world</strong>, just as I am not of the world&rdquo; (John 17:16).</li> </ul> <p>Likewise, in Romans 4:13 Paul says that God made a promise to Abraham that he would inherit the world (<em>kosmos</em>). However, Abraham died without receiving the promise (Heb. 11:13). Therefore, Paul must have in mind that Abraham (and his children by faith) would inherit the world <em>to come</em>. Also, in Hebrews 2:5 we read, &ldquo;For he did not put the inhabited world that is about to come in subjection to angels...&rdquo; Although the Greek word for inhabited world is not <em>kosmos</em>, it is very similar in meaning.</p> <p>From the evidence above, there is a world <em>to come,</em> over which Jesus is the King (Heb. 2:5). In Jesus&rsquo; mind, his kingdom is from another world, it is a heavenly kingdom (Matt. 5:10; 7:21; 10:7; Luke 17:20-21). How does one enter this heavenly kingdom, this new creation? By being born from above (John 3:3, 5). How can one be born from above? By believing in Jesus (John 3:15-16). So, entrance into the new world, the new creation, is through Jesus (2 Cor. 5:17). This aligns perfectly with our understanding of John 1:10 that &ldquo;the world <em>to come</em> came to be through him.&rdquo;</p> <p>Now, one might ask how a future reality has already happened, how it can be said of the &ldquo;world <em>to come</em>&rdquo; that it &ldquo;came to be?&rdquo; The answer deals with understanding the &ldquo;hour now is&hellip; but the hour is coming&rdquo; language of the Kingdom that Jesus uses. In John 5:25 we read, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who heard will live.&rdquo; This refers to the new birth, the spiritual resurrection of believers, that is available right now to those who place their trust in Christ and receive the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38; Eph. 2:6). Yet just a few verses later we read, &ldquo;For the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have practiced evil, to the resurrection of condemnation&rdquo; (John 5:28-29). This is referring to our future resurrection and the full reality of the Kingdom. Therefore, in some sense the world <em>to come</em> is a present reality, and we are currently a new creation if we are in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17). This is how Jesus is able to say that &ldquo;the Kingdom of God has come upon you&rdquo; (Matt. 12:28). However, the fullness of the new creation and the world to come will arrive in the future (1 Cor. 15:24-28). Both are true. Thus, it is perfectly reasonable to think that the &ldquo;world <em>to come</em>&rdquo; has already come to be a reality through Jesus.</p> <p>The third reason to understand this phrase as, &ldquo;the world <em>to come</em> came to be through him,&rdquo; is that the scriptures commonly use the word &ldquo;all things&rdquo; (<em>panta</em>) with the intention of meaning &ldquo;all things&rdquo; in the new creation. The scriptures speak of &ldquo;all things&rdquo; coming to be through Christ and Christ reigning over &ldquo;all things&rdquo; (Col. 1:20; 2 Cor. 5:18; Rom. 11:36; Heb. 2:10; Heb. 1:2; Col. 1:16; Matt. 11:27; John 17:7; 3:35; 13:3; 1 Cor. 15:27; Eph. 1:22; 3:9). For instance, &ldquo;through him (Jesus) God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things&rdquo; (Col. 1:20). This cannot mean &ldquo;all things&rdquo; in totality, but all things that are part of the new creation, since unreconciled people are not part of &ldquo;all things&rdquo; reconciled to God. Likewise, when 1 Corinthians 15:27 says, &ldquo;For he has put all things in subjection under his feet,&rdquo; this does not include the enemies that will be destroyed (1 Cor. 15:25-26), but &ldquo;all things&rdquo; in the new creation. Therefore, since &ldquo;all things&rdquo; is a common way for the scriptures to speak of the new creation, and this verse has immensly strong parallels with John 1:3 in which &ldquo;all things&rdquo; refers to all things in the new creation, it would not be out of the ordinary for the author John to use &ldquo;the world&rdquo; in reference to the new creation.</p> <p>Although, none of these views should likely be taken with 100% certainty as this is a highly metaphorical passage, we believe that the best way to understand John&rsquo;s words here is that &ldquo;the world <em>to come</em> came to be through him.&rdquo;</p>'),

First, we must understand that &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; was being used as a metaphor in reference to Jesus in John 1:1-3, but that here in John 1:14, we must reevaluate if &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; is again being used as a metaphor for Jesus.

Now, we do not have space to do a full rebuttal to the pre-existence of Jesus, but here are a few points in response to arguments for pre-existence.</p> <p>First, the authors of the other gospels seem to believe Jesus&rsquo; birth was his beginning. Matthew 1:1 and 1:18 use the noun <em>genesis</em> (γενεσις #1078) which means birth, or origin. <strong>[fn] [Arndt, William, Frederick W. Danker, Walter Bauer, and F. Wilbur Gingrich. <em>A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature</em>. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000, 192]</strong> Thus, simply put, the bible describes Jesus as having a beginning in the womb of Mary, yet, nowhere is he described as &ldquo;eternally begotten.&rdquo;</p> <p>Jesus is also called the &ldquo;only begotten&rdquo; son, some people might miss the point of this description of Jesus (John 1:14, 18; 3:16; 3:18) because of its being infused with modern ideas of &ldquo;eternal-begottenness&rdquo; which is not a biblical term but a contradictory term. The word &ldquo;only begotten&rdquo; <em>monogenēs</em> (μονογενὴς #3439) has two primary meanings. First, in contexts with sons or daughters it carries the meaning of only begotten (Heb. 11:17; Luke 8:42), and in other contexts it can mean something that is unique, or one of a kind (in 1 Clement 25:2 it is used of the Phoenix). In John 1:18, and likewise in John 1:14, since &ldquo;son&rdquo; follows directly after <em>monogenē</em><em>s</em>, it makes the most sense to understand the meaning to be &ldquo;only begotten&rdquo; son, or simply &ldquo;only son&rdquo; just as Jairus&rsquo;s daughter was his <em>monogenē</em><em>s</em> daughter, or &ldquo;only&rdquo; daughter (Luke 8:42). Being &ldquo;begotten&rdquo; simply means being born or created, and ideas of eternality should not be read into the meaning of the word, in fact, just the opposite. If something is born or created, it is not eternal, and therefore, the use of <em>monogenē</em><em>s</em> points to the fact that Jesus had a beginning about 2,000 years ago. With this in mind, this means that each of the gospel writers believe that Jesus had a beginning (Matt. 1:18; John 1:14; Luke 2:7). Yet, none of the gospel writers explicitly mention a time when Jesus existed before his birth.</p> <p>A better word to use if Jesus had been existing from eternity past would be something like &ldquo;became&rdquo; or &ldquo;transformed&rdquo; but none of the Gospels, including here in John 1:14, teach that Jesus became human or transformed into a human, but that he was created (John 1:18; Matt. 1:18; Luke 2:7; Col. 1:15) just like every other human (Luke 3:23-38). Remember, John 1:14 does not say, &ldquo;Jesus became flesh,&rdquo; we will talk about this more below.</p> <p>In fact, the silence regarding Jesus&rsquo; pre-existence is deafening. Both Matthew and Luke go to great lengths to demonstrate that Jesus&rsquo; bloodline can be traced back to David and ultimately Adam (Luke 3:31; Matt. 1:6), yet there is not the slightest mention of any sort of pre-existence. The gospel writers are seeking to give accounts of the life and ministry of Jesus, but if Jesus had existed for eternity before his 33 year life, and yet one fails to mention his eternal works, and only discusses his earthly life, is there not an astronomical missing piece to the account?</p> <p>As Peter declared by revelation, &ldquo;For he was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:20 &ndash; NASB). Christ was in God&rsquo;s foreknowledge before the world began, but was not yet a reality.</p> <p>Another unsolvable problem caused by the &ldquo;incarnation&rdquo; is that it destroys the correlation that God established of a first Adam and a last Adam. Romans 5:12-19 clearly defines a critical, logical parallel between Adam and Jesus Christ in the context of the redemption of mankind. A major consequence of the doctrine that God became man is that it destroys this key parallel, for Adam is hardly comparable to an eternally pre-existent being. So, how could Jesus be compared to Adam if he pre-existed as God? He couldn&rsquo;t. On the other hand, what we find biblically is that one man accomplished the Fall of humankind, the other man (1 Tim. 2:5) accomplished the redemption of humankind. Jesus was the Last Adam, not the first God-man.</p> <p>The last point in response to pre-existence in John 1:14 is that we must understand the context. We should not think that Jesus created the Genesis creation in a pre-existent state, and then became flesh in John 1:14 because Jesus was already flesh in John 1:10 when he was &ldquo;in&rdquo; the world, and in John 1:11, 12, and 13 when we are to believe in him, namely, in the human flesh and bone Jesus. Thus, the passage is not chronological. Instead, this is a summary statement teaching us that &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; used to create the New Creation is a person (John 1:3, 10, 14; 2 Cor. 5:17) which is in contrast to &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; used to create the Genesis creation that was spoken (Gen.1:3, 6, 9; etc.). So, when we understand that John 1:14 is not chronological, this means that the &ldquo;Word&rdquo; in John 1:1-3 is referring to Jesus when he was in the flesh, not in a pre-existent state. Simply put the &ldquo;Word&rdquo; became flesh in John 1:1 and was flesh all throughout John 1:1-18. Nowhere in the Prologue of John is it taught that Jesus pre-existed without a human body. Likewise, the text in John 1:14 does not say that Jesus became flesh, but that the Word became flesh.</p> <p>Therefore, with all of the evidence above, it is highly unlikely that John meant to use the &ldquo;Word&rdquo; as a metaphor for Jesus here in John 1:14, meaning, &ldquo;Jesus became flesh&rdquo; but rather, he meant to communicate, &ldquo;the Word became flesh <em>in the person Jesus Christ.</em>&rdquo;</p> <p style="line-height:1.38; background-color:#ffffff">The <em>logos</em>, that is, the expression of God, &ldquo;became flesh&rdquo; (came into concretion or physical existence) in Jesus Christ. Jesus is the &ldquo;image of the invisible God&rdquo; (Col. 1:15) and His chief emissary, representative and agent. Since Jesus perfectly obeyed the Father, he represents everything that God could communicate about Himself in a human person. As such, Jesus could say, &ldquo;If you have seen me, you have seen the Father&rdquo; (John 14:9).</p> <p style="line-height:1.38; background-color:#ffffff">It is important to ask why John would say, &ldquo;the Word became flesh,&rdquo; which is a statement that seems so obvious to us. Of course Jesus Christ was flesh. He was born, grew, ate, and slept, and Scripture calls him a man. However, what is clear to us now was not at all clear in the early centuries of the Christian era. The Bible must be understood in the context of the culture in which it was written. At the time John wrote the Gospel of John, the &ldquo;Docetic&rdquo; movement was gaining disciples inside Christianity (&ldquo;Docetic&rdquo; comes from the Greek word for &ldquo;to seem&rdquo; or &ldquo;to appear&rdquo;). Docetic Christians believed Jesus was actually a spirit being, or god, who only &ldquo;appeared&rdquo; to be human. Some Docetics did not believe Jesus even actually ate or drank, but only pretended to do so. Furthermore, some Jews thought that Jesus was an angel. In today&rsquo;s theological literature, theologians refer to this as &ldquo;angel Christology.&rdquo;</p> <p style="line-height:1.38; background-color:#ffffff">John 1:14 was not written to show that Jesus was somehow preexistent and then became flesh. It was written to show that Jesus was not a spirit, god, or angelic being, but a real flesh-and-blood human being. A very similar thing is said in 1 John 4:2, that if you do not believe Jesus has come &ldquo;in the flesh,&rdquo; you are not of God. Likewise in 2 John 1:7 we read, &ldquo;For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh.&rdquo; It seems that John was battling against docetists who were denying that Jesus was a real human. John is assuring his readers (John 1:14; 1 John 4:2; 2 John 1:7) that Jesus was truly human and therefore, he could truly be the perfect sacrifice for our sins.</p> <p style="line-height:1.38"><strong>&ldquo;the only begotten Son from the Father.&rdquo;</strong> This phrase settles any doubt. John has been speaking in highly poetic terms, yet, he finally brings some clarity, telling us that this fleshly Word, or this human Word, is Jesus. In John 1:18 John says that Jesus &ldquo;explains&rdquo; the Father, and words are used for explanation. Thus, one can see the metaphor John would be making by calling Jesus the &ldquo;Word&rdquo; that became flesh. Jesus explains or reveals what God is like. So, he can suitably be called the &ldquo;Word of God&rdquo; (Rev. 19:13; John 1:14).</p>'),

And descending into the abyss is not a literal going down, but to bring something below (in this case, Christ) to us, to where we are. So these figures of speech are all relative to earth.

The Jews incorrectly understood that Jesus was making himself equal with God by calling God his own Father. The Jews simply thought Jesus was making himself equal with God but they were wrong. Indeed, Jesus later says, &quot;the Father is greater than I.&quot; Greater is not equal to.

Moreover, to claim the Jews were correct, one must regard both of the reasons they wanted to kill him: (1) breaking the Sabbath, and (2) making himself equal with God. One must also consistently suppose that Jesus also broke the Sabbath.</p> <p>But Jesus was a Jew born under the Law and a man who did not commit sin. To break the Sabbath was to sin by breaking his God&#39;s Law. Can we conclude that the Jews were correct to understand that Jesus broke the Sabbath? How then can we conclude they were correct to understand Jesus was making himself equal with God?</p> <p>The Jews were insisting Jesus had broke the Sabbath by healing a man on the Sabbath. But carefully regard the following passages:</p> <p>The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him. For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath. John 5:15-16.<br /> <br /> And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. And there was a woman who for eighteen years had had a sickness caused by a spirit and she was bent double, and could not straighten up at all. When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, &quot;Woman, you are freed from your sickness.&quot; And he laid his hands on her; and immediately she was made erect again and began glorifying God. But the synagogue official, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, began saying to the crowd in response, &quot;There are six days in which work should be done; so come during them and get healed, and not on the Sabbath day.&quot; But the Lord answered him and said, &quot;You hypocrites, does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead him away to water him? And this woman, a daughter of Abraham as she is, whom Satan has bound for eighteen long years, should she not have been released from this bondage on the Sabbath day?&quot; Luke 13:10-16.<br /> <br /> Departing from there, he went into their synagogue. And a man was there whose hand was withered. And they questioned Jesus, asking, &quot;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?&quot; so that they might accuse Him. And he said to them, &quot;What man is there among you who has a sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep! So then, it IS lawful to do good on the Sabbath. Then he said to the man, &quot;Stretch out your hand!&quot; He stretched it out, and it was restored to normal, like the other. But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him, as to how they might destroy Him. Matthew 12:9-14.</p> <p>Jesus did not break the Sabbath in John chapter 5. According to Jesus, it was not unlawful to heal a man on the Sabbath and he teaches the Jews that they are wrong about their notions of unlawful healing on the Sabbath. However, even though Jesus did not break the Sabbath they accused him of breaking the Sabbath. The Jews obviously did not agree with Jesus about this matter and sought to destroy him for healing on the Sabbath.</p> <p>Interestingly, Jesus later in John chapter 7 actually comments on the healing incident in John chapter 5:</p> <p>Jesus answered them, &quot;I did one deed, and you all marvel. For this reason Moses has given you circumcision (not because it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man. If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the Law of Moses will not be broken, are you angry with me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath? Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.&quot; See Notes below.</p> <p>It is quite clear that the Jews were wrongly accusing Jesus and he did not break the Sabbath.</p> <p>For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because he not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.</p> <p>In verse 16, we read the Jews were persecuting Jesus for healing a man on the Sabbath. In verse 18, we read that they wanted to kill Jesus for two reason and one of them was breaking the Sabbath. However, the overwhelming weight of the evidence demonstrates that Jesus did not actually break the Sabbath. The Jews were wrongly accusing him. We must then entertain the likelihood they were wrongly accusing him of making himself equal with God.</p> <p>One must make yet another observation. While Jesus WAS NOT breaking the Sabbath, Jesus WAS calling God his own Father. And this the detail which makes this statement confusing to readers. One might be tempted to conclude at this point that the Jews mistakenly accused Jesus of breaking the Sabbath but they were not mistaken about calling God his own Father because Jesus did in fact do so. However, if we are to compare the two reasons the Jews wanted to kill Jesus, the most obvious contrast to make is not:</p> <p>1. Breaking the Sabbath<br /> 2. Calling God his own Father</p> <p>The most obvious contrast to make is:</p> <p>1. Breaking the Sabbath<br /> 2. Calling God his own Father making himself equal with God</p> <p>We cannot conclude that John informs us the Jews were angry simply because he called God his own Father but because they thought that calling God his own Father meant he made himself equal with their God. Notice how Jesus clarifies this for them and explains why they are mistaken:</p> <p>Therefore Jesus answered and said to them, &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, unless it is something he sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also likewise does. For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that He Himself is doing; and the Father will show Him greater works than these, so that you will marvel... He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him... I have come in the name of my Father, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him. How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that is from the only God?</p>'),

Translating like this makes &ldquo;only&rdquo; modify &ldquo;<em>cometh</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;comes&rdquo; which does not actually exist in the Greek text. To put it more clearly, this is how they are really translating the text, &ldquo;seek not the honour that <em>cometh</em> only from God?&rdquo; However, this is not accurate. The adjective &ldquo;only&rdquo; τοῦ μόνου (#3441 monos) modifies God. This is clearly seen because they are both in the genitive case and &ldquo;only&rdquo; is placed right before &ldquo;God&rdquo; in the sentence. &ldquo;Only&rdquo; is not an adverb modifying &ldquo;comes&rdquo; and should not be translated as it is in the KJV.

(41, 1, 43, 12, 32, 0, null, 99, '2022-05-13 02:19:39', '<p><strong>will draw all people to myself.</strong> This passage is notoriously difficult and has been used by Universalists to claim that all people, literally every single human that has ever been born, will be saved regardless of whether they believe in Christ in this life or not. They get this understanding primarily from passages such as this one and passages like 1 Corinthians 15:22, which use the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; to describe the group of people who will be saved.</p> <p>However, as we have looked at in our commentary on John 21:17 and our commentary on 1 Cor. 15:22, oftentimes &ldquo;all&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;all&rdquo; in an unlimited sense but in a limited sense, often limited by context or common sense. Also, if we take &ldquo;all&rdquo; to mean all in an unlimited sense, that seems to contradict many passages of scripture which teach that many people will experience the second death, eternal destruction (Rev. 21:8; Matt. 10:28; 25:46; Mark 9:43).</p> <p>So, if John 12:32 is not saying that Jesus will draw every single human to himself, what is it saying?</p> <p>Context is very helpful here. John 12:20, which begins this section, specifically mentions that Greeks have come up to Jesus to talk with him. Some scholars propose that &ldquo;Greeks&rdquo; in v. 20 means Jews who are not from Jerusalem, in other words Jews who are culturally Greek. Although this is certainly a possible way to understand the word, we feel that these people mentioned in verse 20 are in fact Gentiles, not Jews. There are two reasons for this. First, if John wanted to communicate that these people were actually Jews, but Jews from other places, he could have called them Diaspora Jews, or used the word &ldquo;dispersion&rdquo; as he did in John 7:35. Secondly, John 12:19 suggests that there were certainly Gentiles present in the crowd following Jesus. This verse which is directly before verse 20 says, &ldquo;Therefore the Pharisees said among themselves, &lsquo;You see that you are not accomplishing anything! Look! The world has gone after him.&rsquo;&rdquo; They say that the &ldquo;world&rdquo; has gone after Jesus. The &ldquo;world&rdquo; means all people, or all types of people, Jews and Gentiles alike and it is used that way throughout the gospel of John (John 1:29; 3:16; 14:17). The Pharisees are upset and almost mocking Jesus because even Gentiles were following him, the &ldquo;world&rdquo; was going after him. The Pharisees are seeing all of these Gentiles follow Christ and concluding with their hard hearts that this must not be the <em>Jewish</em> Messiah. It makes no sense why the Pharisees would be mocking Jesus if it was just other Jews from the Dispersion following him. This group who was seeking out Jesus (John 12:12; 12;20) was called &ldquo;the world&rdquo; and &ldquo;Greeks&rdquo;, thus Gentiles are almost certainly included in this group.</p> <p>Now that we have established that these &ldquo;Greeks&rdquo; who were seeking Jesus were likely Gentiles, let us see how this influences our understanding of John 12:32. In this passage, Jesus is dialoguing with this crowd (John 12:29) likely full of Jews and Gentiles (John 12:20-36). Now, most people in the culture who knew about the Jewish Messiah envisioned him as a political ruler who would reign forever (John 12:34), and particularly reign over the Jews. Yet, Jesus painted a different picture of himself as the Messiah throughout the New Testament and even here in John 12. In the immediate context Jesus repeatedly explained that <em>whoever</em> wants to, can have life in the age to come (John 12:25), that <em>anyone</em> could come to him, and that <em>anyone</em> can be honored by the Father (John 12:26). Anyone could be a part of his kingdom. This was revolutionary for these Greeks who were seeking out Jesus (John 12:20). This was a King, a Messiah whose kingdom was not just for Israel but also for these Greeks who were wanting to see and likely follow Jesus.</p> <p>Therefore, when we arrive at v. 32 which reads, &ldquo;I...will draw all people to myself&rdquo; we should not understand this &ldquo;all&rdquo; to mean every single person who has ever been born, but rather &ldquo;all&rdquo; as in &ldquo;anyone,&rdquo; Jew or Gentile. As D. A. Carson puts it, &ldquo;all&rdquo; means &lsquo;all people without distinction, Jews and Gentiles alike&rsquo;, not all individuals without exception (Carson, PNTC, p. 444). This idea of Jesus&rsquo; kingdom being for Jews and Gentiles is also brought about in John 10:16, &ldquo;And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. And there will be one flock with one shepherd,&rdquo; and John 11:51-52, &ldquo;(Now he did not say this on his own, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation, and not for the nation only, but also to gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad).&rdquo; Jesus&rsquo; death and resurrection, his kingdom promises, are not just for the Jews but for <em>anyone</em> who is willing to come to him. This is a prominent theme in John&rsquo;s gospel and is on full display here in John 12:32.</p> <p>In the end, this is a beautiful passage in which Jesus shows his heart for all peoples from every nation, both Jew and Gentile to be saved. He longs for anyone who would be willing to turn from their ways and find forgiveness in Him to do so regardless of what nation or ethnicity (Acts 28:28; Gal. 3:14; 28; Rom. 1:16; Col. 3:11). Therefore, John 12:32 teaches us that salvation is not just for one ethnicity, not just for the Jews, but for &ldquo;all&rdquo; people.</p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>'),

However, as we have shown in our commentary on John 21:17 the phrase &ldquo;knowing all things&rdquo; can and is most often used not to describe someone as omniscient, but &ldquo;all things&rdquo; in a specific context. Also in our commentary on John 21:17 we established that Jesus is not omniscient, he does not know literally every piece of knowledge in the universe (Mark 13:31). So, what are the disciples saying? And why do they follow up this statement with, &ldquo;(you) do not need anyone to question you?&rdquo;</p> <p>Context brings much clarity here. This whole section is part of Jesus&rsquo; teaching at the Last Supper with his disciples. In this section, Jesus has been teaching on his death, resurrection and ascension to the Father, but the beginning of his teaching has been in more veiled terms (John 16:16-18). Then Jesus mysteriously knows exactly what the disciples are questioning (John 16:19) and goes on to tell them more about his ascension using some metaphors (John 16:20-24) and then finally he tells them more plainly (John 16:25-29). This is what leads up to the disciples response here in John 16:30.</p> <p>Now, the confusing thing about the disciples statement, &ldquo;Now we know that you know all things,&rdquo; is that Jesus does not seem to be saying anything vastly profound. Immediately prior Jesus just says that he &ldquo;came from the Father&rdquo; and will &ldquo;go to the Father.&rdquo; In other words, Jesus is predicting his death, resurrection, and ascension. Yet, he predicts his own ascension multiple times before this in the gospel of John (John 13:1; 14:12), so what about Jesus&rsquo; statement here makes the disciples feel compelled to say that Jesus knows &ldquo;all things?&rdquo;</p> <p>Interestingly, the disciples may not be replying specifically to what Jesus says in verse 28, but to what he says all the way back in verse 19. Here, in verse 30, is the first time the disciples get to respond to Jesus&rsquo; teaching. Jesus is speaking from John 16:19-28, and now the disciples get a chance to respond. However, it is what is in their response that suggests that they are responding to Jesus&rsquo; unique knowledge in verse 19.</p> <p>The disciples say, &ldquo;(you) do not need anyone to question you,&rdquo; yet, where is the idea of people questioning Jesus found? In verse 19, we read, &ldquo;Jesus knew that they were wanting to ask him.&rdquo; The disciples were wanting to ask Jesus about his phrase &ldquo;a little while&rdquo; and Jesus knew this. However, he knew this without them directly asking him. This is what makes the disciples say in verse 30 that Jesus &ldquo;knows all things,&rdquo; namely, because Jesus knew what they were talking about without them disclosing that information, Jesus had special knowledge. This also makes sense of why the disciples go on to say in verse 30 that Jesus does not need anyone to question him. In other words, they did not need to question him or to ask him questions (John 16:30) because he already knew what they were going to ask him (John 16:18-19).</p> <p>On the other hand, how would Jesus being omniscient mean that he does not need people to question him? Or how would Jesus knowing that he will go to the Father mean that he does not need people to question him? Both of these understandings fail to properly account for the disciples&rsquo; statement in John 16:30b.</p> <p>The statement by the disciples that Jesus &ldquo;knows all things&rdquo; is not about Jesus&rsquo; omniscience, nor about his knowledge of his death, resurrection, and ascension, but is instead about Jesus&rsquo; knowledge of the disciple&rsquo;s question, before they even asked it (John 16:19). This makes sense of the disciples statement in John 16:30 that Jesus does not need anyone to question him.</p> <p>Thus, Jesus &ldquo;knowing all things&rdquo; means that he knew something they did not expect him to know, that he had <em>access</em> to all knowledge, not that he literally knew all of the trillions of pieces of knowledge in the Universe. For example, if somebody secretly wrote a poem one night, and I walk up to them the next day and say, &lsquo;How is the poem going?&rsquo; They would be shocked and might even say, &lsquo;How did you know that? You must know everything!&rsquo; This special knowledge of Jesus about the disciples, that he seemingly should not have had, prompted the disciples to say, &ldquo;Now, we know that you know all things.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>&ldquo;This is why we believe that you came from God.&rdquo;</strong> The disciples come to this conclusion rather than concluding that Jesus is God. In other words, they did not make the proclamation, &ldquo;You know all things,&rdquo; with the intention of making Jesus equal with the Father, or making him God. Instead they see this act of Jesus as showing that he came from God, not that he was God.</p>'),

John says that Jesus &ldquo;ἐνεφύσησεν&rdquo; breathed on the disciples, which is the exact same verb used in the creation account and breath of life given to Adam in Genesis 2:7.</p> <p>Yet, there are beautiful changes that Jesus makes to the old creation.

Secondly, Jesus is breathing on people who are already living beings, he is not breathing life into them, but rather breathing new life into them through the Holy Spirit. There is truly some remarkable wordplay that Jesus is doing here to show that the new creation is through him, not the old creation.</p> <p>I believe, along with Hall Harris&rsquo; <em>Commentary on the Gospel John</em>, that here, &ldquo;Jesus at this point breathed into the disciples the breath of eternal life.

That Jesus was equal with the Father and equally God? No. This is not what Jesus taught him (14:9-11). Thomas believed that Jesus really was the Christ and that the Father really worked through him (14:9-10). This is what Jesus taught him and this is what John says directly after Thomas&rsquo;s statement, that we should believe that Jesus is the Christ, not that Jesus is God (20:30-31).</li> </ul> <p>Summary &ndash; Just like Jesus said to Thomas earlier, &ldquo;<strong>Believe</strong> me that I am in the <strong>Father</strong> and the <strong>Father</strong> is in me&hellip;&rdquo; (John 14:11). Thomas finally did.</p> <p>If Thomas did not acknowledge the Father when he saw the resurrected Jesus, Thomas failed to listen to Jesus and failed to acknowledge or give credit to the God who raised Jesus from the dead.</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Essentially Thomas is exclaiming that Jesus Christ is Lord and God really worked through him. To believe in the Son, is to believe in the Father (John 12:44). Thomas doesn&rsquo;t just believe in the Son separate from the Father, but he believes in the Son who is intimately tied with his Father and his Father is seen through the Son (John 14:9-11).</p> <p>Trinitarianism claims that because Thomas saw the once dead, now resurrected, flesh-and-bone Jesus, &ldquo;Thomas called Jesus his God.&rdquo; Be honest with yourself. Put yourself in Thomas&rsquo;s place in first century Jerusalem. If you saw and touched the dead-but-now-resurrected-man Jesus, would you think that Jesus was God, or would you think that God (known as the Father) had raised Jesus from the dead?</p> <p>Some Ancient Near East and Greek religions believed in the death and resurrection of their god. Worshipers of Baal, for instance, claimed Baal was dead and came alive. But unlike pagans, biblical thinking Jews believed that the eternal God does not die, nor does he come back to life.</p> <p><strong><u>Apostles&rsquo; Reaction to the Resurrection of Jesus:</u></strong></p> <p><strong>&ldquo;God raised him from the dead!&rdquo;</strong></p> <p><strong>Not: &ldquo;He is God!&rdquo;</strong></p> <p>In all other places in the Bible where the apostles react to the resurrection of Jesus the Messiah from the dead, they do not react by declaring &ldquo;This proves Jesus is God&rdquo;. Rather, they react by declaring: &ldquo;God (the Father) raised the Lord Jesus from the dead&rdquo; (Acts 2:22-24, 2:36, 4:10, 5:30, 10:40, 13:30-37; Rom. 1:4, 10:9, Gal 1:1, 1 Pet. 1:21, etc.)</p> <p>&ldquo;Lord, show us the Father&rdquo;. We might wonder why Philip didn&rsquo;t ask Jesus to show the apostles &ldquo;God the Son&rdquo;?</p> <p>Jesus replied to Philip, Thomas still listening:</p> <p>&ldquo;Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has <strong>seen me</strong> has <strong>seen the Father</strong>. How can you say, <u><strong>&#39;Show</strong> us the <strong>Father</strong>&rsquo;? Do you not believe that I am in the <strong>Father</strong> and the <strong>Father</strong> is in me?</u> The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but the <strong>Father who remains in me does HIS works</strong>. Believe me that I am in the <strong>Father</strong> and the <strong>Father</strong> is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves&rdquo; (14:9-11).</p> <p>The father is seen in Jesus! So, when Thomas sees Jesus rise from the dead, and believes it, he also believes that the Father was at work in him. He believes in the Father as well! To believe in the Son, is to believe in the Father (John 12:44).</p> <p><strong><u>Thomas Finally Gets It, when you see Jesus, you see the Father</u></strong></p> <p>Some eight days after Jesus told Thomas and Philip that they would <strong>see the Father</strong> in him (eight days after Jesus was raised from the dead), Thomas <strong>saw</strong> and touched the once dead but now alive flesh-and-bone-human Jesus (Luke 24:39). Thomas finally knew (understood and believed) what Jesus was talking about. The life, death and resurrection of Jesus revealed the <strong>Father</strong>, the only God (John 17:3), the Giver of Life. Thomas saw (i.e., understood, knew) that the resurrection of Jesus was the work of <strong>God</strong> the <strong>Father</strong>, that the <strong>Father</strong> had given life to Jesus, that indeed the <strong>Father</strong> was in Jesus, the <strong>Father</strong> is known by the resurrected Jesus, the <strong>Father</strong> is declared in the resurrected Jesus, the <strong>Father</strong> is represented by the resurrected Jesus. Just like Jesus said, &ldquo;<strong>Believe</strong> me that I am in the <strong>Father</strong> and the <strong>Father</strong> is in me&hellip;&rdquo; (John 14:11). Thomas finally did.</p> <p><strong><u>Is Thomas talking about two different people?</u></strong></p> <p>ὁ κύριός μου καὶ ὁ θεός μου: &ldquo;My Lord and my God&rdquo;</p> <p>Notice how &ldquo;my&rdquo; is repeated, Thomas does not just say, &ldquo;My Lord and God&rdquo; but &ldquo;My Lord and my God.&rdquo; Should this double use of the pronoun and article affect our understanding of Thomas&rsquo;s statement?</p> <p>Gal. 1:4; 1 Thess. 1:3, 3:13: τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ πατρὸς ἡμῶν: &ldquo;Our God and Father&rdquo; clearly referring to one person, thus one pronoun.</p> <p>Tobit 13:4 &ndash; &ldquo;For he is our Lord and God,&rdquo; (only 1 pronoun in the Greek) and clearly referencing only God the Father.</p> <p>Ultimately, no, Thomas&rsquo;s use of two pronouns does not necessarily mean that he has two people in mind, but it also does</p> <p>------------------------</p> <p>REASONS THE TRINITARIAN INTERPRETATION DOESN&rsquo;T WORK</p> <p>On the day of his resurrection, in words that John recorded only 11 verses prior to Thomas&rsquo;s &ldquo;my God&rdquo; statement, Jesus said to Mary Magdalene, &ldquo;Go to my brothers and say to them &lsquo;I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God&rsquo;&rdquo; (John 20:17). Jesus has a God, who is the same God as the apostles&rsquo; God. Jesus&rsquo;s and Thomas&rsquo;s God is also known as the Father. Jesus said he is Thomas&rsquo;s brother, not Thomas&rsquo;s God.</p> <p>Those who want to claim that &ldquo;Thomas called Jesus God&rdquo; should explain from Scripture why God has a God,</p> <p>Thomas did not say to Jesus &ldquo;YOU are my Lord and my God&rdquo;. Compare Nathaniel&rsquo;s words to Jesus when Nathaniel expressed that Jesus was both the King of Israel and the Son of God: &ldquo;Nathanael answered Him, &quot;Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel&rdquo; (John 1:49).</p> <p>----------------------------</p> <ul> <li>The Father is &ldquo;the only true God&rdquo; (John 17:1, 3).</li> <li>Jesus&rsquo;s works are the Father&rsquo;s works. The works were done by the Father (10:32, 10:37, 14:10, cf. Acts 2:22).</li> <li>Jesus&rsquo;s words are the Father&rsquo;s words (8:48, 12:49-50, 14:10, cf. Deut. 18:18).</li> <li>Jesus&rsquo;s glory is from the Father (1:14, 8:54, 17:5).</li> <li>Jesus has declared or made known the Father (1:18, 14:10-11).</li> <li>If people knew Jesus, they would know the Father (8:19, 12:45, 14:7-11).</li> <li>Because Jesus spoke the Father&rsquo;s words, and because of the miraculous works Jesus did from the Father, people could &ldquo;know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father&quot; (10:38, 12:49, 14:10).</li> </ul> <p>Again, there is never any indication of another divine person, a so-called &ldquo;God the Son incarnate&rdquo; at work or &ldquo;in&rdquo; Jesus. In the Gospel of John &ldquo;God the Son incarnate&rdquo; gets no credit for anything because he doesn&rsquo;t exist. The Gospel of John makes it crystal clear that the God who is at work in Jesus is the Father.</p> <p>Those who want to claim that &ldquo;Thomas called Jesus God&rdquo; should explain from Scripture why God has a God, because the &ldquo;deity of Christ&rdquo; interpretation means that &ldquo;God-Jesus&rdquo; has a God. Also, if Thomas is brother to &ldquo;God-Jesus&rdquo;, does this mean that Thomas is (a) God?</p> <p>&ldquo;Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name&rdquo; (John 20:30-31).</p> <p>John does <strong><u>not</u></strong> say that he recorded these signs so that we would believe that Jesus is God. Rather, John recorded the signs so that we might believe that Jesus is the &ldquo;Christ/Messiah, the Son of God&rdquo;. &ldquo;Christ/Messiah&rdquo; in the Bible is never a title for deity.</p> <p><strong><u>Lord and God, two different titles in the Gospel of John</u></strong></p> <p>The New Testament consistently uses the same titles that Thomas used to distinguish between <strong>God</strong> (the Father) and the <strong>Lord</strong> Jesus Christ. <strong>God</strong> is not the <strong>Lord</strong> Jesus Christ. The <strong>Lord</strong> Jesus Christ is not <strong>God</strong>. There are many, many biblical examples where the Lord Jesus Christ is differentiated from God.

Secondly, this phrase &ldquo;all knowledge&rdquo; is used in scripture multiple times and often it does not carry the meaning of all knowledge in existence. For example:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Ephesians 6:21 reads, &ldquo;Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make <strong>known to you all things</strong> so that you also will know the things about me and how I am doing&rdquo; (Eph. 6:21 REV).</p> <p>Is Tychicus really going to make known to them every single piece of knowledge in the entire universe? No, the &ldquo;all things&rdquo; are things about Tychicus&rsquo; situation.</p> </li> <li> <p>In 1 John 2:20, John says that these faithful Christians &ldquo;<strong>have all knowledge</strong>.&rdquo; Do we really believe that they know all things including the deepest understandings of subatomic reality? The passage goes on to say that the &ldquo;anointing&rdquo; (likely referring to the Holy Spirit) teaches them <strong>all things</strong>. Again, this is not &ldquo;all things&rdquo; such as calculus and biology.</p> </li> <li> <p>In John 14:26, Jesus says that the Spirit will &ldquo;teach you (the disciples) <strong>all things</strong>.&rdquo; Did the disciples become omniscient? No, clearly not.</p> <p>Therefore, we should understand &ldquo;all knowledge&rdquo; in a different way than, &ldquo;all knowledge&rdquo; in the universe when it is applied to people who we know are not omniscient.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now that we have established what knowing &ldquo;all things&rdquo; does not mean, what does it mean? Why does Peter say it here?</p> <p>Well if we look at these examples above, what word captures the authors&rsquo; meanings well? It seems that in all of these examples, something like &ldquo;many&rdquo; is how we would literally capture it in english. Tychicus will make known &ldquo;many&rdquo; things to the Ephesians so that they will be informed about Paul&rsquo;s situation (Eph. 6:21), the faithful Christians do not have all knowledge but they have &ldquo;much&rdquo; knowledge (1 John 2:20), and the Spirit will teach the disciples &ldquo;many&rdquo; things, many truths about God, not every single truth in the universe.</p> <p>Here are even more examples of &ldquo;all&rdquo; really being closer in meaning to &ldquo;many&rdquo;:</p> <ul> <li>&ldquo;You (the disciples) will be hated by <strong>all</strong> for my name&rsquo;s sake&rdquo; (Matt. 10:22), Does Jesus mean literally every single person will hate them? No, he literally means &ldquo;most&rdquo; people, but &ldquo;all&rdquo; is an exaggeration for effect. There were some people who loved the disciples and followed them.</li> <li>&ldquo;<strong>Everyone</strong> is looking for you&rdquo; (Mark 1:37). Did Simon mean that every single person in the town was looking for Jesus without exception or just that &ldquo;many&rdquo; of people were looking for Jesus? Most likely the latter option was true.</li> </ul> <p>Therefore here, in John 21:17, since we know that the subject who knows &ldquo;all things&rdquo; is a person and not the one true God, and since we know that Jesus is not omniscient (Mark 13:32), then the likely meaning of Peter&rsquo;s words here is that Jesus knew &ldquo;many things.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s logic is that Jesus knows &ldquo;many things&rdquo; as the greatest prophet and God&rsquo;s son, so surely he should know something simple: that Peter is his friend.</p> <hr /> <p>More examples could be given but the point is clear. Both &ldquo;all&rdquo; and &ldquo;many/most/a lot&rdquo; are interchangeable at times. We do this in english as well. If 8 out of 10 people in a room are running around screaming and wrestling we could say something like, &ldquo;Everyone in here is crazy!&rdquo; Now, not every single person was, but &ldquo;many&rdquo; were. It seems that the &ldquo;all&rdquo; is used in a very similar way in Greek.</p> <p>By &ldquo;all things&rdquo; Peter likely meant something like our english &ldquo;many things&rdquo;. Now, before this sounds like reading into the text a different meaning, terms &ldquo;all&rdquo; (panta, ) and &ldquo;many&rdquo; () can sometime be interchanged in Koine Greek. In other words, &ldquo;all&rdquo; might really mean something closer to &ldquo;many/much/a lot&rdquo; in english, and vice versa.</p> <p>For example in Romans 5:18-19 Paul says, &ldquo;So then just as one transgression resulted in condemnation for all people...For just as through the one man&rsquo;s disobedience the many were made sinners.&rdquo; Paul makes it clear in verse 18, as well as in many other places of scripture, that all people are condemned, there is not a single person that escapes condemnation, yet, in verse 19 he says the &ldquo;many&rdquo; were made sinners. It seems that Paul is comfortable describing a group that contains &ldquo;all&rdquo; people with the term &ldquo;many&rdquo;.</p>'),

The scholars are divided as to the correct translation and interpretation, a division that is usually based on their theology and the overarching way in which they approach the text.</p> <p>Tetagmenoi which has a large semantic range that includes &ldquo;to put in order, to arrange, to appoint, to ordain (in the sense of appoint to a position). A. T. Robertson writes about tetagmenoi, and says it is the &ldquo;paraphrastic past perfect indicative of tassō, a military term, &lsquo;to place in orderly arrangement.&rsquo; The word &lsquo;ordain&rsquo; is not the best translation here. &ldquo;Appointed,&rdquo; as Hackett shows, is better. The Jews here had voluntarily rejected the word of God. On the other side were those Gentiles who gladly accepted what the Jews had rejected, not all the Gentiles.&rdquo; (A. T. Robertson, Word Pictures in the New Testament, Vol. III, The Acts of the Apostles. Some punctuation and translation of the Latin added for clarity). Some scholars understand this word to best be translated as &ldquo;disposed&rdquo; (or inclined), for example &ldquo;as many as disposed themselves for eternal life, believed&rdquo;. However, disposed is outside of the normal semantic range of the word and is not listed as an interpretive option in the majority of well-respected Greek lexicons (BDAG, M-M, etc.).</p> <p>One point of contention on how to translate this verse occurs with whether to understand Tetagmenoi as middle (appointed themselves) or passive (were appointed) as both are possibilities in the Greek, therefore the decision comes down to context and word meaning. We feel that specifically with the word &ldquo;to appoint&rdquo;, it is less likely that someone appoints themselves and more likely that someone is appointed to something. Also, throughout the rest of the NT when Tasso is in the middle or passive it most often being used as a passive (Luke 7:8; Acts 22:10; Rom 13:1). Although many free-will scholars have used this middle voice to get around this seemingly Calvinistic passage, we believe that there is a better way to understand the phrase in the Greek, which still supports the free-will of humans.</p> <p>This better understanding comes about when we realize that the pluperfect periphrastic participle &ldquo;were appointed&rdquo; almost universally occurs at the same time as the main verb. To be more clear, the &ldquo;appointing&rdquo; happens at the same time as the &ldquo;believing&rdquo;, not millions of years before as the Calvinist would understand this verse. Many scholars see the &ldquo;appointing&rdquo; happening in eternity past, but the &ldquo;believing&rdquo; happening when Paul and Barnabas shared the word of the Lord. However, this is simply not the normal use of the pluperfect periphrastic construction. This construction gives the current background or state of the main verb. Let us look at some examples:</p> <ol> <li>Mark 6:52: οὐ γὰρ συνῆκαν ἐπὶ τοῖς ἄρτοις ἀλλʼ ἦν αὐτῶν ἡ καρδία πεπωρωμένη</li> </ol> <ul> <li>&ldquo;they did not believe, but their hearts were hardened&rdquo; describes the state of their hearts when they disbelieved. The point is not that their hearts were hardened before, and then later they disbelieved, rather, the point is that they disbelieved because their hearts were hardened in that moment.</li> </ul> <ol start="2" type="1"> <li> <p>Acts 9:33: εὗρεν δὲ ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπόν τινα ὀνόματι Αἰνέαν ἐξ ἐτῶν ὀκτὼ κατακείμενον ἐπὶ</p> <p>κραβάττου ὃς ἦν παραλελυμένος</p> </li> </ol> <ul> <li>&ldquo;he found a man&rdquo; is the aorist verb describing the action, &ldquo;who was paralyzed&rdquo; was the state of that man during the action of the main verb, or when he found him.</li> </ul> <ol start="3" type="1"> <li> <p>Acts 4:31: καὶ δεηθέντων αὐτῶν ἐσαλεύθη ὁ τόπος ἐν ᾧ ἦσαν συνηγμένοι καὶ</p> <p>ἐπλήσθησαν ἅπαντες τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος καὶ ἐλάλουν τὸν λόγον τοῦ θεοῦ μετὰ</p> <p>παρρησίας</p> </li> </ol> <ul> <li>&ldquo;was shaken&rdquo; is the aorist verb describing the action, &ldquo;the place in which they were gathered&rdquo; is the periphrastic participle that describes the background/state during which the shaking occured. Their gathering occured during the action of the main verb, not before.</li> </ul> <ol start="4" type="1"> <li>Gal 4:3: οὕτως καὶ ἡμεῖς, ὅτε ἦμεν νήπιοι, ὑπὸ τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου ἤμεθα δεδουλωμένοι</li> </ol> <ul> <li>&ldquo;when we were children&rdquo; is the action, &ldquo;were enslaved to the elementary principles&rdquo; is the pluperfect periphrastic participle describing their state during that action. It could easily be understood &ldquo;were <em>at that time</em> enslaved to the elementary principles.&rdquo;</li> </ul> <p>The normal use is of the pluperfect periphrastic to denote a state which existed in the past, with implication of a prior occurrence which produced it. (Fanning, Buist M. <em>Verbal Aspect in New Testament Greek</em>. Oxford Theological Monographs. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990, 320.) Levinsohn agrees saying that these pluperfect periphrastics are usually &ldquo;portrayed as an ongoing state (which results from a completed event).&rdquo; (Levinsohn, Stephen H. &ldquo;Functions of Copula-Participle Combinations (&lsquo;Periphrastics&rsquo;).&rdquo; In The Greek Verb Revisited: A Fresh Approach for Biblical Exegesis. Edited by Steven E. Runge and Schristopher J. Fresch. Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press, 2016, 317.)</p> <p>This is exactly what we find in Acts 13:48. What is the prior instance that produced this past state? Their belief. They believed and then were appointed to eternal life. One might ask, &ldquo;What is the status of these believers?&rdquo; They are now appointed to life in the age to come, because of their belief. The pluperfect periphrastic participle is a specific construction that discusses the current state/background of an action, not a state before the action happened.</p> <p>Thankfully, in this case, we have help in the interpretation of this verse in the immediate context, which is Acts 13:46, the translation of which is quite clear. Paul was sharing about Jesus Christ in the synagogue in Antioch of Pisidia, and the Jews there rejected his message, but the Gentiles believed it. In response to that, Paul said to the Jews, &ldquo;you judge yourselves unworthy of life in the age to come.&rdquo; According to what Paul said, he understood that the Jews had a choice to believe or not believe in Christ, and they chose not to believe and thus he said they judged themselves unworthy of salvation. There is no indication that Paul thought that the Jews did not really have a choice in the matter but were simply following a course of behavior that had been preordained for them in eternity past. It is in that context, then, that the Gentiles are said to have chosen to believe and thus are then appointed to life in the age to come.</p> <p>The Bible has many verses that point to God giving people the choice to believe or not believe. Deuteronomy 30:19 says, &ldquo;Today I call heaven and earth to be witnesses against you, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore choose life so that you may live.&rdquo; At the end of his life, Joshua confronted the people of Israel and said, &ldquo;choose this day whom you will serve,&rdquo; either Yahweh or pagan gods (Josh. 24:15). Elijah challenged the people to choose the god they would serve: &ldquo;&ldquo;How long will you leap back and forth between the two sides? If Yahweh is God, follow him, but if Baal, then follow him&rdquo; (1 Kings 18:21). There are dozens of verses in the Bible like these, and Acts 13:46-48 is no different. The Jews chose to reject God, the Gentiles chose to accept Him and believe. God gave His only Son that whoever decided to believe in Him would have everlasting life (John 3:16)</p> <p>Therefore, in conclusion, there is no reason to understand this verse as teaching predestination. It is not concerned with that. The verse is concerned with the new status of believers who are appointed to life in the age to come because of their belief.</p>'),

The same idea is being communicated here, even the same word for &ldquo;appointed&rdquo; is used.

Romans 8:28 assures the reader that in all things, God works (present tense) for the good of those who love him. Paul is making a statement about how God (PRESENTLY in the 1st Century) works things together for Christians. This is the context for verses 29 and 30. Yet, one might ask, how do we know that God will work things together for good for those who love him? This is the question I believe Paul answers in vv. 29-30. Paul explains, we know God will work things together for good for Christians BECAUSE he has done so for our forefathers, for Israel, for Old Testament saints. These verses are not referring to Christians of all ages, but to Old Testament saints, we must stop reading ourselves into the bible. The rest of this article will detail reasons why this is the case.</p> <p>Think about the logic of these verses (Rom. 8:28-30) from a typical Arminian or Calvinist perspective: &ldquo;We know that in all things, God works for the good of those who love him&hellip; because he has predestined you and will justify and glorify you.&rdquo; Yet, this logic does not follow. How does a future promise give us assurance that he is currently working for our good? However, in my view the logic is: &ldquo;We know that in all things, God works for the good of those who love him&hellip; because he has done this in the past, for our forefathers.&rdquo;</p> <p>I believe that verses 29-30 are not to be ripped out of context and used to explain the order of salvation, but rather are explaining v. 28. This is seen by the conjunction &ldquo;οτι&rdquo; which is likely an explanatory conjunction here. The two main possibilities for translating &ldquo;οτι&rdquo; are &ldquo;that&rdquo; or &ldquo;for/because&rdquo;, and &ldquo;that&rdquo; simply doesn&rsquo;t work here, introducing v. 29. Paul is answering the question how do we know that all things work together (present tense) for our good? Because (&ldquo;οτι&rdquo;), God has worked all things together for the good of our forefathers. This is what vv. 29-30 are talking about. Please do not skip over the &lsquo;for&rsquo; (in many translations) and take this verse out of context.</p> <p>&ldquo;<strong>Foreknew</strong>&rdquo;. How do we know that this word &ldquo;foreknew&rdquo; is being used to describe people in the past? First, its only other usage in Romans, which occurs in Romans 11:2, is clearly describing old testament saints, the 7,000 who have not bowed to Baal (Rom. 11:4). Yet, there is also another clue in the text that suggests that this passage Romans 8:29-30 is referring to past saints. Namely, that all of the verbs in this section are in the past tense. Those who were &ldquo;foreknown&rdquo; were &ldquo;predestined&rdquo;, and were &ldquo;called&rdquo; and were &ldquo;justified&rdquo; and were &ldquo;glorified&rdquo;. For some reason, modern scholars understand this verse to say that those who were &ldquo;foreknown&rdquo; and &ldquo;predestined&rdquo; (past tense), &ldquo;will be called&rdquo; and &ldquo;will be justified&rdquo; and &ldquo;will be glorified.&rdquo; Modern scholars understand the &ldquo;foreknowing&rdquo; and &ldquo;predestining&rdquo; to be in eternity past but then the calling, justification and glorification applies to the present or future. However, this understanding is highly unwarranted because all of the verbs are in the past tense. It is eisegesis to understand the calling, justifying, and glorifying to apply to Christians from all ages because these verbs occur in the past tense in vv. 29-30. The verbs occurred before Paul wrote Romans. These verbs occur BEFORE the 1st century.</p> <p>The word &ldquo;foreknew&rdquo; has two primary meanings, to &ldquo;know an event/person before they existed&rdquo; or &ldquo;know an event/person in the past&rdquo;. For some reason almost all interpreters understand this term to mean &ldquo;knew (them) before they existed&rdquo;. Yet, I do not think that this word necessarily carries this meaning.</p> <p>When studying all of the uses of this word in the New Testament there seem to be two clear meanings. The first usage is to know something before it occurs or beforehand. This is seen in 1 Pet. 1:20 in which God knows Jesus (or the Messiah) before the foundation of the world, and in 2 Pet. 3:17 in which believers know that people will twist the scriptures beforehand, or before it occurs, so that they would not be carried away into error.</p> <p>However the second kind of usage is seen clearly in Acts 26:5. Paul says that the Jews &ldquo;foreknew&rdquo; that Paul had lived his life as a Pharisee. Yet, it is not that the Jews somehow miraculously knew Paul before he was born and knew that he would grow up to be an educated Jew, but rather, the Jews knew that he had lived as a Pharisee because they witnessed it. However, this witnessing occurred in the past. That is likely why Paul uses &ldquo;foreknew&rdquo; here. So, this is another usage of &ldquo;foreknow&rdquo; , namely, to know something that occurred in the past. <strong>they did not know before he was a pharisee that he would live his life as a pharisee, so the action of &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; occured at the same time as the event, but the event occured before the time of Acts 26:5. They knew this event not before it happened but when it happened, in the past. So it seems that the words can be used to indicated knowing something before the current time (to the speaker), or knowing something before a certain time occured.</strong></p> <p>So, which usage is occurring in Romans 8:29? Here in vv. 29-30 is Paul saying that God knew beforehand certain people and then chose them before they existed? God knew them beforehand, but the question is before they were born, or before the time of Paul&rsquo;s writing of Romans 8? Since the likely referent of this term is Old Testament saints just as in Romans 11:2, this is likely saying that God knew Israel, he chose Israel, he called Israel, he justified Israel and he glorified Israel. And again this is not every single person in physical Israel, but the remnant (Rom. 11:2) who loves God (Rom. 8:28).</p> <p>Now, this &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; of Israel is not simply a knowing of the existence of Israel, because God knows all things and certainly would have known that Israel existed. Rather, this use of &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; refers to an intimate knowledge of Israel, a close relationship, and is even used in scripture in reference to sexual relations (Gen. 4:1). The term &ldquo;foreknew&rdquo; in Romans 8:29 tells us that God was close to Israel, he knew them deeply, it is in reference to those whom God previously knew, not that God &ldquo;knew&rdquo; certain people trillions of years before they were born and selected certain ones to be saved. In fact, the most clear way to translate this term might be to simply say, &ldquo;previously knew&rdquo;.</p> <p><strong>&ldquo;conformed to the image of his Son&rdquo;</strong> Let us quickly address what it means to be &ldquo;conformed to the image of his Son, so that he might be the firstborn among many brothers&rdquo;. Well, what does it mean to be like Christ? What is Christ like now? He is in a glorified body, sinless, and enjoying communion with the Father. So, what does it mean to be conformed to his image? It means to be given a glorified body, sinless, and enjoying communion with the Father. Was this ever decided beforehand, or prophesied by God in the Old Testament? Sure! In Daniel 12:2 we have the promise of resurrection to life, in Psalm 49:15 David clarifies that the righteous will be redeemed from the grave and God will take them to himself, in Job 19:25-27 Job is sure that he will resurrect. These verses make it clear that God decided beforehand that Old Testament saints would be conformed to the image of Jesus. That they would be resurrected and live forever.</p> <p><strong>&ldquo;glorified.&rdquo;</strong> Now, some will contest, &ldquo;Yes, it is possible that &lsquo;foreknew&rsquo; is referring to Old Testament saints, but what about &lsquo;glorified&rsquo; being used in the past tense?&rdquo; Were Old Testament saints glorified? That has to be referring to something future, right?</p> <p>Not exactly. There are numerous examples of &ldquo;glorified&rdquo; being used of Old Testament Israel - Isa. 43:4; 60:9; Ex. 28:2 (priestly garments brought glory); 34:29; 35 (Moses&rsquo; face was glorified after talking with God); Ps. 86:3; 90:15; Lam. 1:8 (Jerusalem had glory); Yet, the most clear example of glory under the old covenant is found in 2 Cor. 3:7-9. In this passage Paul explains that there was glory under the Old Covenant, but there will be more in the new (v. 10).</p> <p>All of the things spoken of in vv. 29-30 did in fact occur to Old Testament saints. God certainly knew Israel (Rom. 11:2-4; Ex. 33:12; 1 Cor. 8:3; 2 Tim. 2:19), decided beforehand that Israel should be conformed to the image of Jesus (This is seen in God&rsquo;s promise of Resurrection: Dan. 12:2; Psa. 49:15; Job 19:25-27), called Israel (Isa. 41:8-9; ), justified Israel (Rom. 4:3; 16; Gen. 15:6; Hab. 2:4), and glorified Israel (2 Cor. 3:7-9; Lam. 1:8; Isa. 43:4; 60:9).</p> <p><strong>Are Arminianism or Calvinism supported here?</strong></p> <p>The Arminian would say that God looked down the corridors of time and saw who would choose him, and then chose them. This does fit the order of the verse nicely in which foreknowledge comes before predestination, however, it leads to a big problem.</p> <p>Could delete this: &quot;First, the grounding objection. The grounding objection highlights that in this scenario something outside of God is the source for something that exists. If God foresees human actions and then bases his choice off of those actions, then really, it is humans that are giving God information. But wait, God created humans. So how could God be getting information from something that he created before he created it? It is an endless cycle of confusion.&quot;</p> <p>Secondly, in Arminian thought God foreknows every individual, so would not every individual be foreknown, predestined, and glorified? This is universalism. One would have to add something to the text that is simply not there to make sense of it. Something like, &ldquo;those whom he foreknew would choose him, he also predestined.&rdquo; This is dangerous eisegesis. It is also a useless statement and action on behalf of God. If all God did was look down the corridors of time, see who would choose him, and then choose them, he is not really choosing them. They are choosing for themselves.</p> <p>Now for the problems with the Calvinistic understanding of this ordo salutis. The most glaring problem is that the order is wrong. Almost all Calvinist scholars understand God&rsquo;s foreknowledge to be a sort of &ldquo;forelove&rdquo; which is fine, however, in v. 29 this occurs before God&rsquo;s act of predestination. In the Calvinist school of thought, God chose you when you had nothing to offer, he chooses some people in eternity past and then sets his love upon them. He gives grace to them because he chose them. However, this is not what we see at all in v. 29 where the &ldquo;forelove&rdquo;, or the love he has for certain individuals occurs before the &lsquo;choosing&rsquo; or &lsquo;predestination&rsquo;. It is also extremely important to notice that these individuals are not being predestined to heaven or hell, but to be conformed to the image of Jesus. This is vital to notice. So, even if this verse was supporting Calvinism up to that point, it says nowhere in the text that people are predestined to heaven or hell. So, the Calvinist doctrine of predestination remains unwarranted. Overall, this text certainly does not help the Calvinist.</p> <p>But what if in the Calvinist vs. Arminian debate of this verse, we are completely missing the mark? What if there is no good solution to this conundrum because we are looking at it all wrong? This passage is not an overview of the order of salvation, but rather a list of the &ldquo;good&rdquo; that God has worked together for Old Testament saints, and that he will continue to work for New Testament saints (v. 28).</p> <p><strong>Summary:</strong> What if Paul is not outlining the order of salvation, but rather encouraging his 1st century readers that God did all of these amazing things (knowing, calling, justifying, and glorifying) for their forefathers, so they can have confidence that God will work for their good as well.</p> <p>The reasons why this understanding is superior are numerous.</p> <p>1. The immediate context in verse 28, naturally leads to the question, &quot;How do we know that God works all things together for the good of Christians?&quot; Answer: Because he has done it all along (v. 29-30). This understanding fits better than: (v. 28) God works all things together for good, (v. 29-30) here is the order of salvation. This understanding does not mesh well.</p> <p>2. The explanatory conjunction ὅτι at the beginning of v. 29 is introducing an explanation of v. 28. Verses 29-30 are not to be read in isolation.</p> <p>3. The only other use of &quot;those whom he foreknew&quot; as a people group in Romans also refers to Old Testament saints (Romans 11:2).</p> <p>4. There is no reason to understand each verb occurs temporally one after the other (there are no textual clues; no words like &ldquo;then&rdquo; or &ldquo;after&rdquo; in this section, and they are all in the same tense)</p> <p>5. The traditional view disregards the past tense of the verbs &ldquo;called&rdquo;, &ldquo;justified&rdquo; and &ldquo;glorified&rdquo;, our view understands these past tense verbs to have occured in the past.</p> <p>6. The traditional view puts verbs that are used in the past tense &ldquo;justified&rdquo; and &ldquo;glorified&rdquo; into the distant future.</p> <p>7. Paul uses οὓς (who or whom) instead of &quot;us&quot; or &quot;we&quot;. We would expect something like: &quot;we were foreknown&quot; not &quot;those whom he foreknew&quot;. This is another piece of clear evidence that Paul has someone else in his mind besides his fellow Christians.</p> <p>The problems with the person who understands this verse to be explaining the order of salvation for New Testament Christians are numerous. They must:</p> <p>1. separate the verse from its immediate context in v. 28</p> <p>2. ignore the explanatory conjunction &ldquo;οτι&rdquo;</p> <p>3. disregard the clear parallel with Romans 11:2</p> <p>4. understand each verb to occur temporally one after the other (for which there are no textual clues; no words like &ldquo;then&rdquo; or &ldquo;after&rdquo; in this section)</p> <p>5. disregard the past tense of the verbs &ldquo;called&rdquo;, &ldquo;justified&rdquo; and &ldquo;glorified&rdquo;</p> <p>6. put verbs that are used in the past tense &ldquo;justified&rdquo; and &ldquo;glorified&rdquo; into the distant future</p> <p>7. understand predestination to be in reference to heaven or hell (disregarding that predestination is never once used to refer to an unbeliever or to hell).</p> <p>8. disregard the οὓς (who or whom) and undestand it to be referring to &quot;us&quot; or &quot;we&quot;, e.g. &quot;we who were foreknown&quot; is how most modern scholars interpret this.</p> <p>There is more that could be said of the follies of interpreting these verses as an ordo salutis, however, you get the point.</p> <p>There is a simpler, more contextual, and truthful interpretation of Romans 8:29-30. The Romans can have confidence that God will work all things together for the good of those who love him, because he has done so in the past. He has worked so many things for the good of Old Testament saints (Rom. 8:29-30), and will continue to do so for New Testament saints.</p>'),

We read the Old Testament, and it is evident that most of it concerns the story of Israel. From Jacob to the exile, the people of God is Israel, and Israel is the people of God. Despite the constant sin of king and people leading to the judgment of exile, the prophets look beyond this judgment with hope to a time of restoration for Israel. When we turn to the New Testament, the same story continues, and Israel is still in the picture. Jesus is described as the one who will be given &quot;the throne of his father David&quot; and the one who &quot;will reign over the house of Jacob [Israel] forever&quot; (Luke 1:32&ndash;33). He is presented as the One the prophets foresaw.</p> <p>The first to believe that Jesus is the promised Messiah are Israelites&mdash; Andrew, Peter, James, John. But in the Gospels, we also hear Jesus speak of building His church, and we see growing hostility between the leaders of Israel and Jesus. We hear Jesus speak of destroying the tenants of the vineyard and giving it to others (Luke 20:9&ndash;18). In the book of Acts, the spread of the gospel to the Samaritans and Gentiles leads to even more conflict with the religious leaders of Israel. So, is Israel cast aside and replaced by this new entity known as the &quot;church&quot;?</p> <p>There are those who would say yes, but the answer is not that simple, for we also run across hints that God is not finished with the nation of Israel. At the end of His declaration of woes on the scribes and Pharisees, Jesus says, &quot;You will not see me again, until you say, &#39;Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord&#39;&quot; (Matt. 23:39). In the Olivet Discourse, He speaks of Jerusalem being trampled underfoot &quot;until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled&quot; (Luke 21:24). In Acts, Peter says to a Jewish audience: &quot;Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago&quot; (Acts 3:19&mdash;21). Finally, Paul says things about Israel that seem to preclude total rejection. Speaking of Israel, he writes, &quot;I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means!&quot; (Rom. 11:1a).</p> <p>In order to understand the relationship between Israel and the church as described in the New Testament, we will need to look at the question in the context of the different answers Christians have given over the years. The traditional dispensationalist view maintains that God has not replaced Israel with the church but that God has two programs in history, one for the church and one for Israel. Traditional dispensationalism also maintains that the church consists only of believers saved between Pentecost and the rapture. The church as the body of Christ does not include Old Testament believers. Progressive dispensationalism has modified some of these views, but the traditional dispensationalist view remains very popular. Some covenant theologians have adopted a view that many dispensationalists describe as &quot;replacement theology.&quot; This is the idea that the church has completely replaced Israel. Jews may still be saved on an individual basis by coming to Christ, but the nation of Israel and the Jews as a people no longer have any part to play in redemptive history.</p> <p>A careful study of the New Testament reveals that both of these interpretations of the relationship between Israel and the church are wanting. The relationship between the people of God in the Old Testament and the people of God in the New Testament is better described in terms of an organic development rather than either separation or replacement. During most of the Old Testament era, there were essentially three groups of people: the Gentile nations, national Israel, and true Israel (the faithful remnant). Although the nation of Israel was often involved in idolatry, apostasy, and rebellion, God always kept for Himself a faithful remnant&mdash;those who trusted in Him and who would not bow the knee to Baal (1 Kings 19:18). This remnant, this true Israel, included men such as David, Joash, Isaiah, and Daniel, as well as women such as Sarah, Deborah, and Hannah. There were those who were circumcised in the flesh and a smaller number who had their hearts circumcised as well. So, even in the Old Testament, not all were Israel who were descended from Israel (Rom. 9:6).</p> <p>At the time of Jesus&#39; birth, the faithful remnant (true Israel) included believers such as Simeon and Anna (Luke 2:25&ndash;38). During Jesus&#39; adult ministry, true Israel was most visible in those Jewish disciples who believed that Jesus was the Messiah. Those who rejected Jesus were not true Israel, regardless of their race. This included many of the scribes and Pharisees. Though they were physically Jews, they were not true Israel (Rom. 2:28&ndash;29). True Israel became def ined by union with the true Israelite&mdash;Jesus Christ (Gal. 3:16, 29).</p> <p>On the day of Pentecost, the true Israel, Jewish believers in Jesus, was taken by the Holy Spirit and formed into the nucleus of the New Testament church (Acts 2). The Holy Spirit was poured out on the true Israel, and the same men and women who were part of this true Israel were now the true new covenant church. Soon after, Gentiles began to become a part of this small group.</p> <p>This is an extremely important point to grasp because it explains why there is so much confusion regarding the relationship between the church and Israel. The answer depends on whether we are talking about national Israel or true Israel. The church is distinct from national Israel, just as the true Israel in the Old Testament was distinct from national Israel even while being part of national Israel. The remnant group was part of the whole but could also be distinguished from the whole by its faith.</p> <p>However, if we are talking about true Israel, there really is no distinction. The true Israel of the Old Testament became the nucleus of the true church on the day of Pentecost. Here the analogy of the olive tree that Paul uses in Romans 11 is instructive. The tree represents the covenant people of God&mdash;Israel. Paul compares unbelieving Israel to branches that have been broken off from the olive tree (v. 17a). Believing Gentiles are compared to branches from a wild olive tree that have been grafted in to the cultivated olive tree (vv. 17b&ndash;19). The important point to notice is that God does not cut the old tree down and plant a new one (replacement theology). Neither does God plant a second new tree alongside the old tree and then graft branches from the old tree into the new tree (traditional dispensationalism). Instead, the same tree exists across the divide between Old and New Testaments. That which remains after the dead branches are removed is the true Israel. Gentile believers are now grafted into this already existing old tree (true Israel/the true church). There is only one good olive tree, and the same olive tree exists across the covenantal divide.</p> <p>What does this mean for our understanding of the relationship between the church and Israel? It means that when true Israel was baptized by the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, true Israel became the New Testament church. Thus, there is continuity between true Israel and the church. This is why the Reformed confessions can speak of the church as existing from the beginning of the world (for example, Belgic Confession, Art. 27). Yet there is discontinuity between the church and national Israel as well, just as there was discontinuity between the faithful remnant and apostate Israel in the Old Testament.</p> <p>Romans 11 and the Future of Israel</p> <p>So, what does this mean for national Israel, the branches that have been broken off from the true Israel because of unbelief? Is God finished with this people as a covenantal entity? In order to answer this question, we must turn to Paul&#39;s argument in Romans 9&ndash;11.</p> <p>In Romans 1&ndash;8, Paul denied that Jews were guaranteed salvation on the basis of their distinctive privileges as Jews. Faith was the key, not ethnicity or any kind of works. Paul argued that all who believe in Jesus are children of Abraham. He also argued that none of God&#39;s promises would fail. All of this would raise serious questions in the minds of his readers. What about Israel? What has become of God&#39;s promises to her in light of her rejection of the Messiah? Has the faithlessness of Israel negated God&#39;s promises? Has Israel been disinherited? Has the plan of God revealed throughout the Old Testament been derailed or set aside? Paul answers these questions in Romans 9&ndash;11.</p> <p>Paul begins Romans 9 with a lament for Israel&mdash;his &quot;kinsmen according to the flesh&quot; (v. 3). He then recounts all the privileges that still belong to Israel&mdash;including the adoption, the covenants, and the promises (vv. 4&ndash;5). In verses 6&ndash;29, Paul defends the proposition he states in verse 6a, namely, that the promise of God has not failed. In verses 6&ndash;13, he explains that the corporate election of Israel never meant the salvation of every biological descendant of Abraham: &quot;not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel&quot; (v. 6b). In verses 14&ndash;23, Paul expands on this, explaining that salvation was never a birthright based on biological descent. It has always been a gift based on God&#39;s sovereign election.</p> <p>In Romans 9:30&ndash;10:21, Paul elaborates on the turn that redemptive history has taken, namely, that while Israel has stumbled over Jesus, Gentiles are now streaming into the kingdom. It is important to observe that in Romans 10:1, Paul writes, &quot;Brothers, my heart&#39;s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.&quot; He&#39;s talking about Israel. The very fact that Paul can continue to pray for the salvation of unbelieving Israel indicates that he believes salvation is possible for them.</p> <p>What Paul has said thus far raises the big question, which he now states: &quot;I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means!&quot; (11:1a). This is the basic theme of chapter 11. In verses 1&ndash;10, Paul demonstrates that God has not rejected Israel by distinguishing between the &quot;remnant&quot; and the &quot;hardened.&quot; Building on what he has already said in 9:6&ndash;13 and 9:27, Paul indicates that just as in the days of Elijah, there is also now a believing remnant (11:2&ndash;5). In contrast with the remnant, chosen by grace (v. 5), is &quot;the rest,&quot; the nation of Israel as a whole, which has been &quot;hardened&quot; (v. 7). God has dulled the spiritual senses of Israel (v. 8), and they have stumbled (vv. 9&ndash;10).</p> <p>Paul then asks, &quot;Did they stumble in order that they might fall?&quot; (11:11a). What is his answer? &quot;By no means! Rather through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous&quot; (v. 11b). What is the present significance of Israel&#39;s stumbling? Paul explains that it has happened as a means to bring a multitude of Gentiles into the kingdom. The hardening of Israel is serving God&#39;s purpose. Their trespass has served as the occasion for the granting of salvation to the Gentiles. Paul states, &quot;Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!&quot; (v. 12, emphasis mine).</p> <p>In verses 11&ndash;12, Paul mentions three events: the trespass (or &quot;failure&quot;) of Israel, the salvation of the Gentiles, and the full inclusion of Israel. The first of these leads to the second, and the second leads to the third. Israel&#39;s trespass, in other words, started a process that will ultimately lead back to Israel&#39;s restoration. This is the first of five places in this short passage where Paul explains the purpose and future of Israel in terms of three stages. Douglas Moo provides a helpful summary:</p> <p>vv. 11&ndash;12: &quot;trespass of Israel&quot;&mdash; &quot;salvation for the Gentiles&quot;&mdash; &quot;their fullness&quot;</p> <p>v. 15: &quot;their rejection&quot;&mdash; &quot;reconciliation of the world&quot;&mdash; &quot;their acceptance&quot;</p> <p>vv. 17&ndash;23: &quot;natural branches broken off&quot;&mdash;&quot;wild shoots grafted in&quot;&mdash;&quot;natural branches&quot; grafted back in</p> <p>vv. 25&ndash;26: &quot;hardening of Israel&quot;&mdash;&quot;fullness of Gentiles&quot;&mdash; &quot;all Israel will be saved&quot;</p> <p>vv. 30&ndash;31: disobedience of Israel&mdash;mercy for Gentiles&mdash; mercy to Israel</p> <p>The repeated occurrence of this &quot;three-stage&quot; process reinforces the idea that Paul is looking forward to a future restoration of Israel. Israel&#39;s present condition is described as &quot;failure&quot; and as &quot;rejection.&quot; Paul characterizes the future condition of Israel in terms of &quot;full inclusion&quot; and as &quot;acceptance.&quot; Israel is not simultaneously in the condition of &quot;failure&quot; and &quot;full inclusion,&quot; of &quot;rejection&quot; and &quot;acceptance.&quot; The &quot;full inclusion&quot; will follow the &quot;failure.&quot; The &quot;acceptance&quot; will follow the &quot;rejection.&quot;</p> <p>Paul anticipates a potential problem in verses 13&ndash;24. Gentile believers who had been taught that they were now God&#39;s people could be easily misled into thinking that this was cause for boasting against the Jews. In these verses, Paul warns against such arrogance. In 11:16&ndash;24, Paul explains the development of redemptive history and the place of Israel within it by using the olive tree analogy that we discussed above. Here again, Paul points to three stages in redemptive history: &quot;natural branches broken off&quot;&mdash;&quot;wild shoots grafted in&quot;&mdash; &quot;natural branches&quot; grafted back in.</p> <p>Paul&#39;s teaching in verses 25&ndash;27 has been at the center of the debate concerning the proper interpretation of chapter 11. Paul writes in verse 25: &quot;Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.&quot; Here Paul is still speaking directly to the Gentiles (see v. 13). He wants them to understand a &quot;mystery.&quot; In this context, the mystery involves the reversal of Jewish expectations concerning the sequence of end-time events. The &quot;mystery&quot; is that the restoration of Israel follows the salvation of the Gentiles.</p> <p>In verse 26, Paul continues the sentence begun in verse 25: &quot;And in this way all Israel will be saved.&quot; The biggest debate here is the meaning of &quot;all Israel.&quot; Charles Cranfield lists the four main views that have been suggested: (1) all the elect, both Jews and Gentiles; (2) all the elect of the nation Israel; (3) the whole nation Israel, including every individual member; and (4) the nation Israel as a whole, but not necessarily including every individual member. Since Paul repeatedly denies the salvation of every single Israelite, we can set aside option (3).</p> <p>John Calvin understood &quot;all Israel&quot; in verse 26 to mean all the elect, both Jews and Gentiles. Paul does use this language in other places in his writings. The problem with understanding &quot;all Israel&quot; in 11:26 in this sense is the context. Throughout verses 11&ndash;25, Paul has consistent ly dist inguished between Jews and Gentiles. We also have to remember that Paul&#39;s concern in these chapters is for his kinsmen according to the flesh (9:1&ndash;5). His prayer in this context is for the salvation of unbelieving Israel (10:1). In Romans 11:26, Paul is revealing that the prayer of 10:1 will be answered once the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.</p> <p>Other Reformed theologians, such as O. Palmer Robertson and Herman Ridderbos, have argued that &quot;all Israel&quot; refers to all the elect of the nation of Israel throughout the present age. As with the view that understands &quot;all Israel&quot; to be the church, there is truth in this interpretation. The Jews who are being saved in the present age are not any different from the Jews who are to be saved in the future. The problem with this interpretation, as with the previous one, is that it conflicts with the immediate context. As John Murray observes, &quot;While it is true that all the elect of Israel, the true Israel, will be saved, this is so necessary and patent a truth that to assert the same here would have no particular relevance to what is the apostle&#39;s governing interest in this section of the epistle.&quot; Paul is not in anguish over the salvation of the remnant. They are already saved. He is in anguish over unbelieving Israel. It is this &quot;Israel&quot; for whose salvation he prays (10:1), and it is this Israel that he says will be saved in verse 26.</p> <p>The interpretation of &quot;all Israel&quot; that best fits the immediate context is that which understands &quot;all Israel&quot; as the nation of Israel as a whole, but not necessarily including every individual member of ethnic Israel. Paul consistently contrasts Gentiles and Israel throughout this chapter, and he continues to do so in the first half of the sentence we are examining (v. 25). There is no contextual reason to assume that Paul changes the meaning of the term Israel in mid-sentence here. The &quot;Israel&quot; that will be saved (v. 26) is the &quot;Israel&quot; that has been partially hardened (v. 25).

In v. 9 the woman was created for the man. In v. 10 this is why she should have a symbol of &ldquo;authority&rdquo; over her. And in v. 3, the heiarchy of woman&lt;man&lt;Christ&lt;God works, but not if you take it as &ldquo;source&rdquo; as the egalitarians do, because Christ is not the source of &ldquo;men&rdquo; or &ldquo;humankind&rdquo;...</p> <p>--------------------------------------</p> <p>So when we get to 1 Corinthians, we need to understand that Paul had been already been spreading his message of equality among humans far and wide. The Corinthians had received his message, and had gone about applying it to often extreme degrees. The first letter to the Corinthians is not his first message to them - on the contrary, it&#39;s a response to their response to his message.</p> <p>Paul spends most of his letter correcting the over-zealous and abusive applications of things he had told them. So when we get to chapter 11 we need to keep in mind that what Paul is correcting are his own ideas - taken too far. In fact, that&#39;s how he starts his discourse - praising them for trying to follow his teachings and example, before he sets out to suggest that they&#39;ve taken it in the wrong direction.</p> <p>The Corinthian women had apparently taken to the idea of their equality to heart. Not only were they praying and prophesying, participating openly in public, they had removed their veils, the symbol that they were married.</p> <p>It made sense. They were equal, right? Why should they continue to wear something that might indicate someone else&#39;s influence over them? Male and female didn&#39;t matter, why should they continue to wear a symbol of their femininity?</p> <p>But this was incredibly offensive. It was like simultaneously throwing away your wedding ring, and burning your bra in public.</p> <p>So Paul makes a very delicate argument, trying to give them a rationale for not ticking off everyone around them, while still holding on to their sense of equality. He makes an argument about source.</p> <p>Now, the text says &quot;head&quot;, and it is conventional to take this as some kind of a statement about authority structures and dominance, but that&#39;s not what &quot;head&quot; means. In Greek usage, the word head indicated either your literal head, or metaphorically, the source of something, like a stream or a river. *</p> <p>So Paul brings in the Genesis 2 creation story to try to talk about how some things come from other things, and how it is appropriate to show some kind of respect towards that. This is kind of like arguing that you should respect your grandmother. No one would argue that your grandmother is more important than you, or should have authority over you, and yet most of us would think it&#39;s tasteful to show some kind of deference to the fact that she helped bring you into existence.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know about you, but when I spend time with my grandmother, I try not to embarrass her in public. If we&#39;re in a store, or walking somewhere, I don&#39;t feel the need to constantly point out that I&#39;m a grown man and can do whatever I want. I don&#39;t wear clothes that she&#39;ll find terribly offensive, or do some of the ridiculous things that I might feel comfortable with, but would make her nervous.</p> <p>Paul is making a similar argument here. Why embarrass your husband? Why get him mocked by the rest of the community? Maybe even more importantly, why give other people a reason to think you might be engaged in some kind of orgy?</p> <p>What&#39;s fascinating is the response Paul expects. He anticipates an argument that as christians, they don&#39;t care at all about cultural or external physical markers. He accepts that as legitimate, but tries to prove that in fact, they do care, and are being inconsistent. He suggests that if they really don&#39;t care, they should just shave their heads, traipse around looking like prostitutes, and be done with it.</p> <p>Why is he so concerned? Because this isn&#39;t being done in dark rooms with closed doors. People are watching. The reference to &quot;angels&quot; in verse 10 is not talking about spirit beings (who would have no concern for head-coverings!), it&#39;s talking about &quot;messengers&quot;, people who are gossiping about what they see, spreading it to the whole town. *</p> <p>These early christian get-togethers had to be the subject of great curiosity. They are letting women speak! They are having slaves sit at the table! People were paying attention to every move, and Paul is concerned about sending the wrong message. You can almost hear him whisper it: someone&#39;s at the window!</p> <p>In all of this, as in all other places, Paul walks a thin line. He wants christians to be acting out of a new conception of society, where men and women, Jew and Greek, slaves and slave-holders, all have to live together in real relationship. Nothing can compromise that scandalous message, because it is core to what they are doing. And yet, Paul does not want to stir up trouble for themselves on other issues. Just because it&#39;s okay to break local customs and desecrate sacred cows, doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s the best choice. Better to pick their fights, so that the core message is clear, and there is nothing else to criticize them for.</p> <p>Nowhere in this does Paul suggest that the women should stop displaying their equality. They are to continue speaking and participating (verse 5), they are to understand that they are all interdependent and that no one is over another (verse 11), and most tellingly, they are ultimately to make up their own minds - because it is the woman&#39;s own choice (verse 10), and no one should argue about the decision they make (verse 16).</p> <p>Paul cares a lot. He makes a strong argument. But when it comes down to it, his ultimate statement is that each individual is free to make their own decision. Unlike every other structure on earth, the kingdom of God is the place where all are equal and free, and where no one can dominate another.

Therefore, to have her hair uncovered was essentially the same as having her genitalia exposed. They believed that her hair attracted sperm to go throughout a woman&rsquo;s body, and helped with fertility.</p> <p>The question then is, why does it dishonor her? In a moment of public worship to have your genitalia exposed is shameful. Why is it one and the same as if she were shaved?

It would bring shame not only on the woman but on her husband. It would be equivalent to the shame of having her head shaved or hair cut off (a punishment for adultery).8 Indeed, as Payne notes,&ldquo;&hellip;in Hellenistic Roman, and Jewish cultures for centuries preceding and following the time of Paul, virtually all of the portraiture, sculpture, and other graphic evidence depicts respectable women&rsquo;s hair done up, not let down loose.&rdquo;9</p> <ul> <li>Putting a metaphorical meaning on v4-5, Paul is saying that if the woman or man shames their own head in a literal sense, they bring dishonour upon their metaphorical head.

The subject in v. 34-35 is the women, so why would Paul then say, did the word of God come to you alone (Masculine)? If the women were claiming that the word of God came to them alone we would expect a feminine here. But, if this is a quotation of false teaching by the men in the Corinthian church it would make sense why Paul would say rhetorically, &ldquo;Did the word of God come to you alone (Masc.)?&rdquo; No, it came to the women also&hellip; this would be Paul&rsquo;s point. The masculine gender of &ldquo;only ones&rdquo; in verse 36 does not seem to follow logically after 14:34-35 and its instructions to women unless verse 36 is a reprimand to a group of men that wants to silence women.</li> </ol> <p>Reasons why for later addition to text:</p> <p>As noted, verses 34-35 sit uncomfortably within 1 Corinthians 14, both grammatically and hermeneutically. In fact, if you skip over verses 33b-35, and go straight from verse 33a to verse 36, the passage flows and makes good sense. Furthermore, because of the existence of textual variations involving verses 34-35 in several early manuscripts of 1 Corinthians, some scholars, notably Gordon D. Fee and Philip B. Payne, suggest verses 34-35 may have been inserted into the text of Paul&rsquo;s letter by an unknown scribe at a very early date.[20]</p> <p>In a few early (mostly Western) texts of 1 Corinthians 14, verses 34-35 are located after verse 40 (e.g., Codex Claromontanus, Codex Augiensis, Codex Boernerianus, Codex Regis, and some Latin manuscripts). Metzger (1994:499) offers an explanation for the different location of these verses: &ldquo;Such scribal alterations represent attempts to find a more appropriate location in the context for Paul&rsquo;s directive concerning women.&rdquo;</p> <hr /> <p>DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH 1 COR. 11:7.</p> <p>Craig Keener takes into consideration the culture of learning in the first century and proposes that the problem being addressed in 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 was women who were interrupting the flow of congregational meetings by asking too many rudimentary questions. He writes, &ldquo;Throughout the first-century Mediterranean world, novices were expected to learn quietly, but more advanced students were expected to interrupt all kinds of public lectures with questions.&rdquo; (Keener 2001:50) Keener suggests the Corinthian women may not have realised that interrupting the meetings with their basic questions was culturally inappropriate, even shameful.</p> <p>A tongues-speaker, male or female, is to be silent (sigaō) and stop speaking in tongues if there is no one to interpret (1 Cor. 14:28 ESV).<br /> ~ A prophet, male or female, is to be silent (sigaō) and stop prophesying if someone else receives a revelation (1 Cor. 14:30).<br /> ~ Women are to be silent (sigaō) and stop asking questions if there is anything they want to learn (manthanō); they should keep their questions for home (1 Cor. 14:34-35). These questions may have been directed to the men and women prophesying: prophecy was so that everyone could learn (manthanō) and be encouraged (1 Cor. 14:31 CSB).</p>'),

Paul doesn&rsquo;t forbid women from praying and prophesying in the assembly. On the contrary, he wishes for them to do it in a way that honors male headship (1 Cor. 11:2&ndash;16). Among other things, that means that women may prophesy but that they may not judge prophesies (1 Cor. 14:34&ndash;36).

If you think about it this would be Paul&rsquo;s logic &ndash; I do not permit a woman to teach or have authority over a man because men were created first and Eve was deceived once. If thereby Paul is saying that women are more easily deceived and should not be teachers, there are two problems with that. First, that means they should not be teaching anybody at any age level or any gender, they are simply more easily deceived than men. Secondly, that is a very high standard that God is holding women to, if God&rsquo;s reasoning is: women were deceived once therefore, they are more easily deceived, therefore, they can never be teachers, have men not done the same thing, and therefore, would be disqualified? Also, if the problem is that women are more easily deceived, why are they encouraged to teach younger women (Titus 2:3-5)? They should not be teaching anybody.</p> <p>1 Tim. 1:3 is huge! Also, 2 Cor. 11:3 seems to show that Paul believed that men could be deceived just as Eve was deceived? Would that not also disqualify them from ministry?</p> <p>&quot;The opposing arguments of what is falsely called &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; &rdquo; (mentioned in 1 Timothy 6:20-21) involved the belief in female superiority over men because virgin women experienced special union with God and could share their spiritual power and insights with men. Hence Paul condemns people who forbid marriage in the Ephesian church for spiritual reasons (1 Tim. 4:3a). The virgin status of Artemis explains why virginity and celibacy were highly esteemed virtues among some Ephesians, but Paul saw such asceticism as dangerously entangled with local religion. Contrary to a theory popularized by Kroeger in I Suffer Not a Woman, no evidence exists that people in first-century Asia viewed Artemis as a fertility or sex goddess and therefore practiced temple prostitution (see Sondra Gahn, The Identity of Artemis in First-Century Ephesus). Artemis was actually praised as the divine tomboy who could save (&quot;Artemis the Savior&quot; was a common regional epithet) and protect people without any man&rsquo;s help&mdash;a strength celebrated in her great hunting exploits.</p> <p>Only the Egalitarian view properly accounts for v. 15.</p> <p>Also, we need to discuss</p> <p>The account in On the Origin of the World is as follows:</p> <p>After the day of rest Sophia sent her daughter Zoe, being called Eve, as an instructor in order that she might make Adam, who had no soul, arise so that those whom he should engender might become containers of light. When Eve saw her male counterpart prostrate she had pity upon him, and she said, &lsquo;Adam! Become alive! Arise upon the earth!&rsquo; Immediately her word became accomplished fact. For Adam, having arisen, suddenly opened his eyes. When he saw her he said, &ldquo;You shall be called &lsquo;Mother of the Living.&rsquo; For it is you who have given me life.&rdquo; (Ed. James Robinson, &ldquo;On the Origin of the World&rdquo;, The Nag Hammadi Library in English: Revised Edition (San Francisco: Harper, 1988), 115:31-35, 116:1-7.)</p> <p>Support for the idea that Paul is correcting the Ephesian women is also found in his use of &ldquo;not&rdquo; in 1 Tim. 2:14. Paul does not simply say that Eve was deceived. He says, &ldquo;Adam was not deceived, but the Woman...&rdquo; was deceived. He seems to be correcting false teaching regarding the creation narrative, that Adam was the one who was deceived.</p> <p><strong>Complementarian</strong></p> <ol type="1"> <li>If it was because of a lack of knowledge it doesn&rsquo;t make sense why he would say I do not permit you to teach &ldquo;a man&rdquo;, it should be teach <em>at all.</em></li> <li>I can&rsquo;t get over 1 Cor. 11:3 where there is a clear authority structure girl &lt; man &lt; christ&hellip;.</li> </ol> <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Why authority instead of Originator?</p> <p>First, because abuse authority is the much more common usage.</p> <p>Secondly because Paul is contrasting authentew with quietness. It makes sense to contrast abusing authority with being quiet and in submission, it does not make sense to contrast false teaching with being quiet.</p> <hr /> <p>3 reasons why it&rsquo;s a woman, not all women, in 1 Timothy 2:12</p> <p>One reason for my belief that verse 12 is about a couple, is Paul&rsquo;s switch from the plural &ldquo;men&rdquo; and &ldquo;women&rdquo; in 1 Timothy 2:8-10 to the singular &ldquo;man&rdquo; and &ldquo;woman&rdquo; in verses 11-12. There is a reason why Paul switched from plural to singular, and we need to pay attention to the apostle&rsquo;s choice of language.[1]</p> <p>The second reason I believe 1 Timothy 2:12 is about a couple is because of the singular verb sōthēsetai in 1 Timothy 2:15. This verb is correctly translated as &ldquo;she will be saved&rdquo; and refers to a woman, not plural women. The plural verb meinōsin &ldquo;they continue&rdquo; in the same verse probably refers to the couple: &ldquo;she [a woman] will be saved &hellip; if they [the couple] continue &hellip;) [2]</p> <p>The third reason I believe 1 Timothy 2:12 is about particular people, and not referring to all women in general, is because the context of the second half of 1 Timothy 2 is the problem behaviour of certain people in the Ephesian church.</p> <p>In 1 Timothy 2:11-15, Paul uses the rhetorical device of asyndeton[3] and narrows his focus to the problem behaviour of one of these rich women. This woman was not ready to teach&mdash;she needed to learn quietly&mdash;and she was acting in a domineering or controlling manner (Greek: authenteō) towards a man, most likely her husband. Her controlling behaviour may have stemmed from a concern about the effects of sex and procreation on salvation, a not uncommon concern in the early church.[4]</p> <p>Two options for understanding 1 Tim. 2:13-14 &ndash;</p> <p>1. Paul is correcting the false teaching that these women were teaching by correctly telling the Genesis story. This can be seen by Paul saying Adam was not deceived but Eve was, his tone seems to be correcting a false thought that Adam was deceived.</p> <ol start="2" type="1"> <li>1 Tim. 2:13-14 serves as a reminder of what happens when you do not learn but take authority when you are not supposed to. Eve took authority, was deceived and deceived Adam.</li> </ol> <ul> <li>The third reason I believe 1 Timothy 2:12 is about particular people, and not referring to all women in general, is because the context of the second half of 1 Timothy 2 is the problem behaviour of certain people in the Ephesian church.</li> <li>V. 11 is the absolute key. This is not for all women for all time.

But if he was talking about people in Ephesus alive at that time, it makes sense why he would admonish them to continue in trust and love.</p> <p><strong>The Theme of Virginity in the Acts of Paul and Thecla</strong></p> <p>A couple of weeks ago I read the Acts of Paul and Thecla. This work of fiction dates to around 150 AD and is thought to have been written by a presbyter somewhere in Asia Minor.[1] It was well known in the early church, and several prominent early church fathers refer to it (Tertullian, Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine, Methodius, Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, and others) which indicates its widespread influence.[2]</p> <p>The repeated theme of virginity and chastity (not having sex) is striking in the Acts of Paul and Thecla. (This theme is a feature in all the Apocryphal Acts.) In the Acts of Paul and Thecla, this theme is apparent from the beginning where Paul brings the &ldquo;word of God&rdquo; in a house church in Iconium. This &ldquo;word of God&rdquo; is mostly about chastity and sexual self-restraint (egkrateia) which is associated with resurrection. Thirteen beatitudes constitute Paul&rsquo;s message; the following four are specifically about chastity:</p> <p>Blessed are those keeping their flesh chaste, because they will be a temple of God.<br /> Blessed are those with self-control (egkrateia), because God will speak to them.<br /> Blessed are those having wives as though not having them (i.e. being married and celibate), because they will receive an inheritance from God.<br /> Blessed are the bodies of virgins, because their bodies are pleasing to God and they will not lose the reward of their chastity; because the word of the Father will be a work of salvation to them in the day of his Son, and they will have rest forever. (Sections 5-6)</p> <p>The last beatitude links virginity with salvation. Paul&rsquo;s supposed message is that the life of a good Christian is a life of celibacy and that chaste living has a bearing on our salvation and on our resurrection.[3] Thecla, the virgin par excellence, embraces this teaching and resolutely remains a virgin despite bitter opposition and mortal danger. And she later becomes a teacher and preacher endorsed by Paul.[4]</p> <p><strong>The Theme of Not Having Children in the Egyptian Gospel</strong></p> <p>Other early Christian writings also extol the virtue of celibacy, and they explicitly connect it with not having children. In the days before relatively safe and widely available contraceptives, having children was not an unexpected result of the sexual union of husband and wife. Several Christian documents that promoted virginity and celibacy, by extension, also promoted not having children. One of these documents is the Gospel of the Egyptians, dated to between 80-150.[5]</p> <p>The Gospel of the Egyptians does not survive as a whole but several early Christian authors quote from it, giving us glimpses of its content and ethos.</p> <p>Ron Cameron writes,</p> <p>&ldquo;Despite the paucity of the extant fragments, the theology of the Gospel of the Egyptians is clear: each fragment endorses sexual asceticism as the means of breaking the lethal cycle of birth and of overcoming the alleged sinful differences between male and female, enabling all persons to return to what was understood to be their primordial and androgynous state. This theology is reflected in speculative interpretations of the Genesis accounts of the Creation and the Fall (Gen. 1:27; 2:16-17, 24; 3:21), according to which the unity of the first man was disrupted by the creation of woman and sexual division. Salvation was thus thought to be the recapitulation of Adam and Eve&rsquo;s primordial state, the removal of the body and the reunion of the sexes.&rdquo;[6]</p> <p>Clement of Alexandria is one person who quoted selections from the Gospel of the Egyptians and provided commentary on them.[7] In Stromata 3.9.66 (written around 200) he provides this quotation: &ldquo;Salome said, &lsquo;How much longer will people (anthrōpoi) continue to die?&rsquo; . . . The Lord answers: &lsquo;So long as women bear children.&rsquo; Salome answers, &lsquo;I have done well, then, in not bearing children.&rsquo;&rdquo;[8]</p> <p>A saying contained in the Gospel of Thomas gives a different account of an incident recorded in Luke 11:27. Jesus&rsquo; supposed statement in saying 79 in the Gospel of Thomas highlights the perceived ideal of celibacy and not having children:</p> <p>&ldquo;A woman from the crowd said to him, &ldquo;Blessed is the womb which bore you and the breasts which nourished you.&rdquo;<br /> [Jesus] said to her, &ldquo;Blessed are those who have heard the word of the Father and have truly kept it. For there will be days when you will say, &lsquo;Blessed is the womb which has not conceived and the breasts which have not given milk.&#39;&rdquo; (Logos 79, Gospel of Thomas) [9]</p> <p><strong>Asceticism and Gnosticism in 1 Timothy</strong></p> <p>The person, or community, who compiled the sayings in the Gospel of Thomas had Gnostic sympathies which included encouraging asceticism. Tertullian, in his work against Gnostics (written sometime around 200), mentions 1 Timothy in the context of the teaching of the Gnostic teachers Marcion (c. 85-160) and Apelles. Tertullian writes, &ldquo;Instructing Timothy, [Paul] attacks those who forbid marriage. This is the teaching taught by Marcion and his follower Apelles.&rdquo; (Prescription Against Heretics 33) Apparently, Marcion did not allow married converts to be baptised.[10]</p> <p>Irenaeus, in his work opposing Gnostic heresies (written about 180), mentions the school of the Gnostic teacher Saturninus who spoke strongly against marriage and procreation. Irenaeus wrote, &ldquo;They say marriage (gamein) and procreation (gennan) are from Satan. Many of those, too, who belong to his school, abstain from animal food, and draw away multitudes by a feigned temperance of this kind.&rdquo; (Against Heresies 1.24.2 cf. 1 Tim. 4:3) Irenaeus likewise criticises the teachings of Tatian (120-180): &ldquo;. . . like Marcion and Saturninus, he declared that marriage was nothing else than corruption and fornication.&rdquo; (Against Heresies 1.28.1) [I provide Irenaeus&rsquo;s paragraph about Tatian in a postscript below.]</p> <p>C.K. Barrett, writing about the Pastoral Letters of the New Testament (which includes First Timothy), notes an implied attack on Paul and his teaching &ldquo;by those Jewish Gnostic Christians whose heretical kind of Christianity lurks in the background of the Pastorals.&rdquo;[11] Gnosticism was a &ldquo;dualistic transcendent religion of salvation&rdquo; that swept across the Roman Empire and was a real threat to apostolic Christianity.[12] Christian Gnosticism syncretised (or combined) Greek philosophical and pagan religious ideas with Christian and Jewish teaching.[13] Asceticism, including celibacy or chastity, was a major tenet of several strands of Gnosticism.</p> <p>There are several indications in First Timothy that the heresy being addressed in the letter was an early or incipient form of Gnosticism that promoted chastity. One of these indicators is 1 Timothy 4:3 where Paul states that some in the church at Ephesus were forbidding marriage. This heretical teaching is one of the factors behind Paul&rsquo;s advice that idle younger widows remarry (1 Tim. 5:11-15). It is possible that Paul&rsquo;s statements in 1 Timothy 2:13-14 corrected some of the many false ideas circulating about Adam and Eve that would become popular among some Gnostic teachers. Furthermore, Gnostic-like beliefs, especially sexual renunciation, may be squarely behind Paul&rsquo;s corrective teaching on salvation in 1 Timothy 2:15.</p> <p><strong>&ldquo;The Childbirth&rdquo; or &ldquo;Having Children&rdquo; in 1 Timothy 2:15?</strong></p> <p>Yet she will be saved through childbearing (tēs teknogonias) if they continue in faith, and love, and holiness with moderation. 1 Timothy 2:15</p> <p>1 Timothy 2:15 is an enigmatic verse and several interpretations have been put forward to explain its meaning. Some scholars suggest that this verse is about physical safety during the childbirth process.[14] A few English translations of 1 Timothy 2:15 convey this idea (e.g., NASB; Darby Translation, Moffat Translation, Weymouth New Testament).</p> <p>Another interpretation of verse 15 is that &ldquo;childbearing&rdquo; should be translated as &ldquo;the childbirth&rdquo; (tēs teknogonias) and that it refers to the birth of Jesus Christ, through whom salvation comes. (The ISV, and footnotes in NEB and NLT, convey this idea.) Those who propose &ldquo;the childbirth&rdquo; interpretation highlight the connection between the birth of Jesus Christ and the seed of the woman promised in Genesis 3:15. However, while two verbs in 1 Timothy 2:13-14 are borrowed directly from the Septuagint&rsquo;s version of Genesis 2:7-8, 15 and 3:13 (plassō: form/ mould and apatatō: deceive), 1 Timothy 2:15 has no clear linguistic connection with Genesis 3:15.</p> <p>The definite article is also highlighted in &ldquo;the childbirth&rdquo; interpretation. Abstract nouns, however, are commonly used with a definite article in Greek and these articles are usually left untranslated in English translations. So the definite article may not be significant. Some also make the argument that we can&rsquo;t be sure of the precise meaning of teknogonia.[15] Yet, the cognate infinitive teknogonein appears a few chapters later in 1 Timothy where it is typically translated as &ldquo;to have children&rdquo; or &ldquo;to bear children&rdquo; (1 Tim. 5:14).</p> <p>The difficulty of &ldquo;the childbirth&rdquo; interpretation of 1 Timothy 2:15 is that elsewhere in 1 Timothy, Jesus and salvation are mentioned together plainly, but Jesus is not mentioned in 2:15. I agree with Margaret Davies when she says, &ldquo;Had Christ&rsquo;s birth been the subject, the name Christ Jesus would have been highlighted, as in 1:15 and 2:5.&rdquo;[16] Nevertheless, I believe that salvation, rather than safety, is the meaning in 2:15.[17] The verb sōthēsetai (&ldquo;s/he will be saved&rdquo;) is usually, but not always, used in the New Testament with the meaning of eschatological salvation. For example, &ldquo;&hellip; the one who endures to the end will be saved&rdquo; (Mark 13:13b).</p> <p>I suspect &ldquo;Gnostic, or semi-Gnostic, ideas&rdquo; are the impetus for Paul&rsquo;s teaching in 1 Timothy 2:15.[18] It is plausible that in this verse Paul was assuring a married woman (or women) in the Ephesian church that if she renounced celibacy, had sex with her husband, and became pregnant, she would not jeopardise or lose her salvation. Rather, &ldquo;she will be saved.&rdquo;[19]</p> <p>I suspect Paul&rsquo;s message in 1 Timothy 2:15 is that salvation is not dependent on celibacy and remaining childless, but involves continuing in faith, and love, and holiness (hagiasmos) which are &ldquo;expressions of a saved life.&rdquo;[20] Holiness is an ascetic ideal, but Paul wants holiness &ldquo;with good sense&rdquo; (meta sōphrosunē), or, in moderation. He doesn&rsquo;t want extreme piety or asceticism. By associating holiness with childbirth, he indicates that marriage, sex, and procreation are not opposed to piety as many Christians, including Jewish Proto-Gnostic Christians, were teaching in Ephesus and in many other parts of the Roman world.[21]</p> <p>Paul&rsquo;s teaching about marriage and having children in 1 Timothy 2:15, 4:3-4 and 5:11-15 (cf. Tit. 2:4-5) is distinctly different from the teaching attributed to him in the Acts of Paul and Thecla.[22] And it is the antithesis of the teaching found in many Christian documents that circulated widely in the second century, documents that strongly promoted virginity and chastity as saving virtues.</p>'),

George Knight III in his commentary on the Pastoral Epistles, pp. 157-159 writes, &ldquo;it would be strange for the apostle of liberty, who considered widows and widowers &lsquo;free to be married &hellip;, only in the Lord&rsquo; (1 Cor 7:39) and who used this principle of freedom to illustrate his teaching on the law (Rom. 7:1-3), to deny this freedom to a potential church officer whose spouse has died.</p> <p>&ldquo;The real issue is not so much where he has come from but who he is now by God&rsquo;s grace.

The Granville Sharp rule does not apply if it is clear that the two things being discussed are different, for example, with gold and silver. We non-Trinitarians assert that there was no ambiguity in the minds of the first-century readers between God and Jesus. They were known to be different from each other. Because no ambiguity between Christ and God would arise in the minds of the readers if the second article was omitted, it can be (and was) omitted without a problem. Likewise, there was no need for a second article in Matthew 21:12 in the phrase, &ldquo;all the [ones] selling and buying,&rdquo; or in Ephesians 2:20 in the phrase, &ldquo;the apostles and prophets,&rdquo; because no one would ever think that &ldquo;sold&rdquo; and &ldquo;bought&rdquo; meant the same thing, or that &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; and &ldquo;prophets&rdquo; were referring to the same people. This sort of distinction is apparent in numerous passages throughout the Bible.</p> <p>The limitations and exceptions to the rule stated by him are as follows: In this case, then, it appears that the article is not repeated, because its repetition is not necessary to prevent ambiguity.</p> <p>2. No similar rule applies to proper names. &lsquo;The reason,&rsquo; says Middleton, &lsquo;is evident at once; for it is impossible that John and Thomas, the names of two distinct persons, should be predicated of an individual&rsquo; (p. 68).</p> <p>This remark is not to the purpose [i.e., &lsquo;is not correct&rsquo;], for the same individual may have two names. The true reason for this limitation is, that proper names, when those of the same individual, are not connected by a copulative or copulatives, and therefore that, when they are thus connected, no ambiguity arises from the omission of the article.</p> <p>5. Lastly, &lsquo;we find,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;in very many instances, not only in the plural, but even in the singular number, that where attributives are in their nature absolutely incompatible, i.e., where the application of the rule would involve a contradiction in terms, there the first attributive only has the article, the perspicuity of the passage not requiring the rule to be accurately observed&rsquo; (p. 92).</p> <p>All from STF commentary</p> <p><br /> <span style="font-size:11pt; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-style:normal"><span style="text-decoration:none">Titus 2:13 - appearing of the GLORY of our great God and savior Jesus Christ, not of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ.

Overall, I think I would just stick with what we have because of the context where the God has a God.</p> <p>Need to figure out why UBS thinks if it is autou then we should translate it &ldquo;your throne is God&rdquo;? p. 663, A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, United Bible Societies, 1971. Nevermind, I get it, the &ldquo;his kingdom&rdquo; would be in reference to God&rsquo;s kingdom. Therefore the &ldquo;You&rdquo; the whole time would be in reference to Jesus: &ldquo;God is your throne&rdquo; and &ldquo;God, your God&rdquo; has anointed you. EHHH BUT this whole scheme makes the Septuagint reading very different from the NT?</p> <p>If the last word in Hebrews 1:8 is autou, this actually really changes things. It would mean that &ldquo;the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of his kingdom.&rdquo; This means that there are two characters in view in this verse: God, and someone who is over the Kingdom (i.e. &ldquo;his kingdom&rdquo;). This resolves the tension that the King is being called God.</p> <p>They also noted that later manuscripts which read &ldquo;your (sou) kingdom&rdquo; are now in agreement with the corresponding passage in the Greek OT Septuagint! (Remember that the UBS Committee recognizes, as do most Bible scholars, that the NT manuscript that differs slightly from the Septuagint is more likely to be correct than another one which perfectly agrees because copyists strongly tended to deliberately &ldquo;correct&rdquo; Septuagint quotes they found in the NT .)</p> <p>Reasons from a Trinitarian why it should be &ldquo;your throne is God&rdquo;: Statistically, (ὁ θεὸς) is rendered &ldquo;God&rdquo; hundreds of times in the NT, as opposed to the scant few times (3x) as &ldquo;O God.&rdquo; Going with the odds again, the author of Hebrews (Paul for me) uses (ὁ θεὸς) as &ldquo;God&rdquo; dozens of times and only one other time as a vocative, 10:7. When we look to the context, Hebrews 1:7, it is God speaking to a worshipper about the angels, and so, he is not being addressed. In 1:8, it is God speaking to a worshipper about the Son, and so God again is not being addressed, The following verse, Hebrews 1:9, God is still talking to a worshipper about the Son, saying of the Son, &ldquo;You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you &hellip;,&rdquo; meaning here, again, it is not God being addressed. The author of Hebrews is quoting from Psalm 45:6, which was being addressed to a human king, likely King Solomon, who actually sat on God&rsquo;s throne.</p> <p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Both from the immediate context and with the presence of translation problems, there are quite a few reasons why we do not believe that this verse is not calling Jesus &ldquo;God&rdquo; nor should it be translated, &ldquo;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.&rdquo;</p> <p>First, evidence that the psalm is speaking of a human king is in Psalm 45:7, which says, &ldquo;You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of exultation above your peers.&rdquo; That the text calls God, &ldquo;your God,&rdquo; i.e., the king&rsquo;s God, shows that the king is inferior to God. &ldquo;God&rdquo; does not have a God. It would make no sense to be calling the king &ldquo;God&rdquo; here, as the clear biblical teaching is that there is one God (1 Cor. 8:6; John 5:44; 17:3), so if Jesus is the one true God, how could he have a God?</p> <p>Secondly, the context of both Hebrews 1 and Psalm 45 make it clear that this king being referred to is not the supreme God because this king has been blessed by God (Psa. 45:2), has a wife (Psa. 45:9), and simply put, he is a human king (Psa. 45:1, 5, 13, 15), not the supreme God. We also know this passage in Psalm 45 is not originally about Jesus because the king has a wife. The queen is said to be a woman of foreign descent, possibly from Tyre (Ps. 45:12) who was told to forget her own people and father&rsquo;s house (Ps. 45:10), and she and her husband have an ivory house (Ps. 45:8). Those facts have led some commentators to suggest that this psalm is referring to the marriage of the Phoenician princess Jezebel to King Ahab, who had an ivory palace (1 Kings 22:39). But that is untenable since Ahab does not fit the characteristics of a godly king that are so prominent in the psalm. Solomon, who also married foreign women and lived in luxury, is a much more likely candidate.</p> <p>Thus, the original quote in Psalm 45:6 is not actually referring to Jesus, but originally refers to an Old Testament king, but also finds later application in Jesus. If the verse is calling the king &ldquo;God,&rdquo; then that would make both Solomon and Jesus God, which is untenable, and there is no internal reason to apply Psalm 45:6 to the Messiah without verse 7 applying to the same king. That would be eisegesis, reading into the verse to make it fit one&rsquo;s theology. If the psalm is calling the Messiah &ldquo;God,&rdquo; then the Davidic king is also God. So, if a Trinitarian is using this verse to prove Jesus is God, it actually would prove too much and make Solomon God too.</p> <p>Thirdly, the king&rsquo;s God &ldquo;anointed&rdquo; him, setting him above his &ldquo;peers.&rdquo; This is evidence against a Trinitarian interpretation of the verse for a number of reasons. One is that &ldquo;God&rdquo; does not have any peers to be set above, whereas the human king of Israel, including the Messiah, does have peers. The Messiah, Jesus Christ, did have peers because he was completely human and not a God-man as Trinitarian theology asserts. Also, Psalm 45:7 says this king loved righteousness and hated wickedness, and &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; God anointed him. This makes perfect sense if the king is human, but if this king is &ldquo;God,&rdquo; was he really anointed because he loved righteousness? It makes no sense that &ldquo;God&rdquo; needed to be anointed at all.</p> <p><strong>Translation</strong>:</p> <p>Now let us address some reasons why Hebrews 1:8 should not be translated, &ldquo;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.&rdquo; Although &ldquo;Your throne, O god, is forever and ever&rdquo; is a legitimate translation of Hebrews 1:8, there is evidence that &ldquo;Your throne is God forever and ever&rdquo; is actually a better translation.</p> <p>The renowned Greek scholar and Trinitarian, A. T. Robertson noted that the Greek word <em>theos</em> (God) could be understood as a vocative, &ldquo;O God,&rdquo; or as a nominative, as in the phrase, &ldquo;God is thy throne&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thy throne is God.&rdquo; He wrote: &ldquo;Either [translation] makes good sense.&rdquo; While it is true that from a strictly translational point of view either a vocative or nominative translation is acceptable, all translation is informed by context and scope, and the context strongly argues against the translation &ldquo;Your throne, O God.&rdquo;</p> <ol type="1"> <li>There is a very good reason for believing that the correct translation of Psalm 45:6 is &ldquo;God is your throne,&rdquo; or some other translation (some are given below) that takes &ldquo;God&rdquo; as referring to the Most High God and not a human &ldquo;god.&rdquo; If Psalm 45:6 is translated, &ldquo;Your throne, O God&hellip;,&rdquo; then Psalm 45:6 would be the only verse in the whole Bible in which a human being is directly and personally addressed as &ldquo;god.&rdquo; There are times when humans are referred to as gods (John 10:33-34) or as a god to someone else (Moses over Pharoah in Ex. 7:1), meaning that they act as a god over that person, they rule over them; but nowhere else in the Bible is a human being personally addressed as &ldquo;god.&rdquo; Added to that evidence is the fact that &ldquo;Elohim&rdquo; occurs four times in the psalm (Ps. 45:2, 6, and 45:7 (twice)), and three of them clearly refer to God, so it fits the psalm that the fourth would also refer to God the Father.</li> <li>Robert Alter gives another argument why &ldquo;O God&rdquo; is likely not the correct translation. In <em>The Hebrew Bible: A Translation with Commentary</em> writes &ldquo;Some construe the Hebrew here to mean, &lsquo;Your throne, O God,&rdquo; but it would be anomalous to have an address to God in the middle of the poem because the entire psalm is directed to the king or to his bride.&rdquo;</li> <li>Another argument for the translation, &ldquo;Your throne is God forever and ever,&rdquo; is that it matches the parallelism in the Greek between Hebrews 1:8a and 1:8b. In Hebrews 1:8b we have two nominative nouns and in English we add an &ldquo;is&rdquo; in between. This looks like: &ldquo;the scepter (nominative noun) of uprightness is the scepter (nominative noun) of your kingdom.&rdquo; It is very common in both Greek and Hebrew to add a &ldquo;to be&rdquo; verb to make a sentence understandable in English, and almost every modern translation translates Hebrews 1:8b this way. Interestingly, the first half of the verse has the same construction, a nominative noun and then another nominative noun with no verb. Thus, it is fitting to supply an &ldquo;is&rdquo; in between these two nouns just as most translations do in the second half of the verse. Hebrews 1:8a would read &ldquo;Your throne (nominative noun) is God (nominative noun)&rdquo; and 1:8b reads, &ldquo;the scepter (nominative noun) of uprightness is the scepter (nominative noun) of your kingdom.&rdquo; So, it would make the parallelism flow beautifully, in that there are two metaphors being used of this king and his kingdom. God is metaphorically his throne (or his source of authority) and the scepter of uprightness is metaphorically the scepter of his kingdom. In other words, this king rules with righteousness instead of a physical scepter.</li> </ol> <p>The main argument against the translation &ldquo;Your throne is God,&rdquo; is that the phrase does not make sense to some people. But we must understand that the verse is not using &ldquo;throne&rdquo; as a seat, a chair, but as it is often used in the Bible, as a source of authority. In fact, if &ldquo;throne&rdquo; is understood to be a chair then the verse does not make sense: the &ldquo;throne&rdquo; is the source of authority. In essence, the verse is saying, &ldquo;your source of authority is God.&rdquo; For example, when David chose Solomon to be king, one of David&rsquo;s top men, Benaiah said to David, &ldquo;&hellip;may he [Yahweh] be with Solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David&rdquo; (1 Kings 1:37). In speaking of Solomon&rsquo;s &ldquo;throne&rdquo; being greater than David&rsquo;s, Benaiah was saying that Solomon would have more authority and dominion than David did, which came to pass. The use of &ldquo;throne&rdquo; referring to the authority that the throne represents also occurs in the New Testament. When the angel Gabriel appeared to Mary, he told her she would give birth to the Messiah and he said, &ldquo;the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David&rdquo; (Luke 1:32). In saying that Mary&rsquo;s son would have the &ldquo;throne&rdquo; of David, he meant the authority that the throne represented. That authority went all the way back to God&rsquo;s promise to David that his &ldquo;throne&rdquo; would endure forever, which is why Gabriel then said, &ldquo;...he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end&rdquo; (Luke 1:33).</p> <p>&ldquo;Your throne is God forever&rdquo; means that God is the authority, the &ldquo;throne&rdquo; of the king, and the king reigns with the authority of God. This king, and by extension the Messiah, the true king of Israel, has been specially anointed by God (Psa. 45:7).</p>'),
(41, 1, 58, 1, 10, 2, null, 99, '2023-01-27 03:09:20', '<p>Perhaps, he is just using an old creation passage and applying it to Jesus, through whom the New creation comes, and the reason he quotes through v. 12 is because it emphasizes the eternality of Jesus. NOPE</p> <p>There is one thing that is clear that should influence our interpretation of the passage. The phrase, &ldquo;the heavens are the works of your hands&rdquo; is cleared up by Psalm 8 and Hebrews 2:7, they are the works of the Father&rsquo;s hands, because Jesus is set over the works of the Father&rsquo;s hands (Heb. 2:7 i think) not his own hands. Therefore, however we want to interpret vv. 10-12 it should be in light of this. There is something else we must note that influences the interpretation of this passage. Hebrews 2:5 states &ndash; For he did not put the inhabited world that is about to come (about which we are speaking) in subjection to angels&mdash; and since Hebrews 2:1-4 is not about the new creation, we should be looking for the New Creation in Hebrews chapter 1.</p> <p>Thus, two things should inform our understanding of Hebrews 1:10-12. First, it is the works of the Father&rsquo;s hands, and secondly, he is likely referring to the new creation.</p> <p>Hebrews 1:10-12 is fairly clearly about the new creation when reading it with fresh eyes. It speaks of heaven and earth being rolled up, and &ldquo;changed like a garment&rdquo; (Heb. 1:11). This is exactly what we get from New Testament prophecies concerning the new creation (1 Cor. 15, 2 Pet. 3). You might ask, what does this have to do with Jesus? Well, this new creation is what Jesus is going to reign over at God&rsquo;s right hand (Heb. 1:13). This is the exact connection the author makes in Hebrews 2:7, he says, &ldquo;You crowned him with glory and honor, and set him over the works of your hands. 8You put all things in subjection under his feet.&rdquo; And he goes on to say, &ldquo;Now in putting all things in subjection to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him.&rdquo; (Heb. 2:8). Notice the present tense of v. 8, &ldquo;he left nothing that <em>is not</em> subject to him.&rdquo; Thus, Jesus is currently reigning over all things in the new creation, but the author clarifies that there is a future time when we will see all things subjected to him. The argument throughout Hebrews 1:10-12 to Hebrews 2:5 to Hebrews 2:7-8 is that there is a new creation that will occur (&ldquo;changed like a garment&rdquo; in Heb. 1:11 and &ldquo;we will see all things&rdquo; in Heb. 2:8), and Jesus has been set over this new creation (Heb. 1:13; 2:8).</p> <p>---------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Is it reasonable to suppose that in a section where the author is trying to establish for his readers the fact of the son&rsquo;s superior status compared to angels, that he would pull a passage out of the OT that speaks of God creating the the heavens and the earth and simply apply it to the son, even though it makes no mention of the son. How would this be convincing to the readers? It seems to me that this would only be effective if the readers already believed that the son was Yahweh, the creator. But if they already believed this then the whole exercise of the author in this chapter is superfluous; you would not have to prove to Jews that the Creator is superior to angels.</p> <ul> <li>If this is about angels it makes sense why the author then goes on in v. 13 to say, &ldquo;BUT to which of his angels has he ever said&rdquo;, this only makes sense if the thing he said right before was about angels!</li> </ul> <p>Structure: 8-9 Jesus</p> <p>10-12 angels</p> <p>13 Jesus</p> <p>14 angels</p> <p>The mention of &lsquo;the heavens&rsquo; would have evoked the thought of angels in the mind of 1st century Jews.</p> <p>Psalm 33:6 is a big one! It directly connects Heavens with hosts or angels</p> <p>Deut. 32:43 (LXX) &ndash; &ldquo;Rejoice you heavens with him, and let all the angels of God worship him.&rdquo;<br /> Here the &lsquo;heavens&rsquo; and the &lsquo;angels&rsquo; are synonymous thoughts, thus the heavens implies the angels.<br /> <br /> Ps. 89:5 &ndash; &ldquo;The heavens praise your wonders, O Yahweh, also your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones.&rdquo;<br /> To say that the heavens praise Yahweh is to say that those in the heavens praise Yahweh.</p> <p>Neh. 9:6 &ndash; &ldquo;You alone are Yahweh. You created the heavens, the highest heavens with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to all of them, and the heavenly host worships You.&rdquo;</p> <p>Deut. 32:1 &ndash; &ldquo;Listen, O heavens, and I will speak; hear O earth, the words of my mouth.&rdquo;</p> <p>So it is both reasonable to conclude and probable that the author of Hebrews quoted Ps. 102:25-27 specifically because of the clause which states that the heavens will be rolled up like a robe and like a garment be changed, and that his readers would have understood this. His point would be that while the throne of the son will last for ever, whatever function angels presently have is only temporary and will come to an end. In order to get the flow of the author&rsquo;s thought I will combine the two citations but only with the pertinent clauses, according to what I think the author&rsquo;s purpose was in citing each passage.<br /> <br /> But to the son [it says], &ldquo;Your throne, O god, will last for ever and ever . . .<br /> and [it also says] . . . the heavens (and by implication those who rule in the heavens) . . . will wear out like a garment. You will role them up like robe; like a garment they will be changed . . .&rdquo;</p> <p>So then, this view of the passage solves all of the problems that are inherent in the other views, both the trinitarian and BU views. It also maintains the original context of Psalm 102 and the flow of thought of the author&rsquo;s argument. ALL FROM TROY SALLINGER</p> <hr /> <p>There are three predominate BU interpretations: 1.The author does intend that Ps. 102:25-27 refers to the son, but that the creation of the heavens and earth refer to the new creation not the original one. Hence, the son is the creator of the new heavens and earth. 2.The author does not intend the verse to refer to the son but to the Father, and he employs it to show the everlasting nature of God&rsquo;s kingdom in the words, &ldquo;But you remain the same, and your years will never end.&rdquo; 3. Through wisdom Christology, Jesus is the embodiment of wisdom and we know that God created all things through his wisdom, so in this way it could be said of Jesus that he created the heavens and the earth. None of these interpretations is satisfying for the following reasons: #1 is untenable because it would involve the perishing of the new heavens and earth. Attempts have been made to alleviate this problem but they are not convincing. Plus this understanding has the same problem that the trinitarian interpretation has, i.e. the passage does not mention the son at all. #2 doesn&rsquo;t seem right because it breaks the flow of thought of the whole passage, in which the author is switching back and forth between citing verses about the son and verses about angels. Why would the author interrupt this flow to simply show that Yahweh created the heavens and the earth? #3 doesn&rsquo;t work because there are no hints in the passage at all that we are to make this connection. Nothing in all of Hebrews 1 talks about Jesus as wisdom, and certainly nothing in v. 10-12 compares wisdom and Jesus at all. Also, Hebrews 1:2 is not talking about Jesus creating all things, but creating the &ldquo;ages&rdquo;, or the new creation, the new covenant age. This option seems to be totally reading into the text. Widsom is not personified anywhere in this text. MOST IS FROM TROY SALLINGER</p> <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p><strong>Why this verse does not prove Trinitarianism:</strong></p> <p><strong>Context:</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Jesus is said to be the heir of all things, how could Jesus be heir, if he is God and created all things.</strong></p> <ol start="2" type="1"> <li><strong>Jesus became better than the angels after his sacrifice and resurrection (Heb. 1:4), not before. Before his resurrection he was made a little lower than the angels (Heb. 2:7). How could God be lower than the angels, his own creation?</strong></li> <li><strong>Jesus inherited a name more excellent than the angels (Heb. 1:4), namely &ldquo;Son&rdquo; (Heb. 1:5-6). It would be much more simple to call Jesus, God, then his name would be superior, but rather the scriptures teach that Jesus is the Son of God.</strong></li> </ol> <p><strong>The Verse itself:</strong></p> <ol type="1"> <li><strong>The verse is talking about God not Jesus. (The quotation from Psalm 102 in the LXX! is the psalmist talking about God and to God).</strong></li> <li><strong>Clearly, the &ldquo;works of your hands&rdquo; are the Father&rsquo;s in 2:8, so it makes the most sense to understand the &ldquo;works of your hands&rdquo; in 1:10 to be the Father&rsquo;s as well.</strong></li> <li><strong>Structurally, it makes more sense to understand Hebrews 1:10-12 to go with Hebrews 1:13-14. The &ldquo;de&rdquo; (but) introducing v. 13 typically means that something is being contrasted with the previous thought.</strong></li> <li><strong>The overall argument of the author makes more sense to understand it as the Father&rsquo;s works in vv. 10-12, not Jesus&rsquo; works (see argument analysis below).</strong></li> <li><strong>Jesus cannot be credited with the exact same thing that the Father is credited with, that would be a case of confusing persons. Even with the abomination of Desolation which had multiple people fit that title, the bible speaks of multiple abominations of desolation (Antiochus Epiphanies in Ez. 36 and Nero or Titus in Matt. 24), yet they are desolating TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. They are not credited with desolating the exact same things, in the same way we cannot credit Jesus with the exact same thing as the Father.</strong></li> </ol> <p><strong>Why did the author of Hebrews choose this passage particularly?</strong></p> <p><strong>I think the purpose of this quote is to help explain what exactly Jesus is reigning over at God&rsquo;s right hand. Hebrews 1:10-12 explains that it is not just the old creation (v. 10) but also the new creation (v. 11) which Jesus will be reigning over. So, when we read that Jesus is reigning over the works of God&rsquo;s hands (2:8) and over all things (2:8b), we understand that to be the present heavens and earth and the new heavens and earth. This also aligns nicely with what he goes on to say in Hebrews 2:8. Namely, that all things have been put in subjection to Jesus (2:8b) but we do not yet see all things that are subjected to him (2:8c), because the new heavens and earth will also be subjected to him. Understanding Hebrews 1:10-12 to be in reference to the Father agrees much more nicely with Hebrews 2:5-8 than understanding vv. 10-12 to be in reference to Jesus.</strong></p> <hr /> <p>Argument analysis:</p> <p><strong>Doesn&rsquo;t make sense:</strong></p> <p>1. Jesus created the old heavens and earth.</p> <ol start="2" type="1"> <li>But no angel has been asked to reign over all things with God (v. 13). Rather, they are servants (v. 14).</li> </ol> <p>OR</p> <ol type="1"> <li>Jesus created the New Heavens and Earth.</li> <li>But no angel has been asked to reign over all things with God (v. 13). Rather, they are servants (v. 14).</li> </ol> <p><strong>Does make sense:</strong></p> <p>1. God created all things.</p> <ol start="2" type="1"> <li>But no angel has been asked to reign over all things with God (v. 13). Rather, they are servants (v. 14)</li> </ol> <p>ALSO: I can&rsquo;t imagine &ldquo;the works of your hands in v. 10 to be Jesus&rsquo; works, and the &ldquo;works of your hands&rdquo; in 2:8 to be the Father&rsquo;s works. This would be quite strange.</p> <p>The argument is</p> <p>God created all things (v. 10-12) and he has subjected all things under Christ&#39;s feet (v. 13). This flows perfectly with what follows: For God did not subject to angels the world to come...<br /> You have placed all in subjection under his feet (2:5-8)</p> <p>You have appointed him over the works of Your hands. (in Psa. 8:6, from which this is quoted in Hebrews 2:5-8; Psa. 8:4-5).</p> <p>Observe carefully how the writer is reasserting the same message. In chapter one he refers to the works of God&#39;s hands and then asks to which angel has God ever asked to sit at His right hand. To sit at God&#39;s right hand is to have authority over all heaven and earth (see Matthew 28:18). Now observe how he says the same thing again in chapter 2. God placed all His creation under Jesus&#39; feet, all the works of His hands. BOTH passages are about God giving Jesus authority over all His creation.</p> <p>1:10 You Lord in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the WORKS OF YOUR HANDS</p> <p>1:13 - God has appointed Jesus over all things.</p> <p><br /> 2:8 You have appointed him (Jesus) over ALL THINGS AND PUT ALL THINGS UNDER HIS FEET.</p> <p>It is abundantly clear who the writer had in mind in verse 10, the Father, and the works of the Father&#39;s hands, the Father who asked Jesus to sit at His right hand (v.13) thereby appointing Jesus over the works of His hands.</p> <p>The Trinitarian claim is based on a wishful assumption that God is saying a second thing to the Son when he sees the word &quot;AND&quot; at the beginning of verse 10. However, the evidence forcefully shows that God is not the speaker at verse 6 or verse 7 or verse 8. The writer uses the Greek verb legei at verses 6 and 7 which must be translated as &quot;IT says&quot; since God did not say these words. The writer&#39;s style is also to use kai (&quot;and&quot;) to introduce a new argument. Hebrews 1:10-12 is not to be read as a unit with Hebrews 1:8-9 but to be read as a unit with verse 13. Moreover, we have several contrasts in this chapter between what God does for Jesus vs. what God does for the angels. In verse 13, we find that HE asks Jesus to sit at his right hand, something he has never asked an angel to do. Who is this HE but the Lord of verse 10? And that is very the point of Hebrews 1:10-12, that is, in all the history of creation, from beginning to end, God the Father has never ever asked, and never will ask, an angel to sit at His right hand. The heavens are the works of the Father&#39;s hands and He has not appointed an angel (see 2:5) but He has appointed a man, the son of man, Jesus, over all the works of His hands by seating Jesus at His right hand crowning him with glory and honor. The writer&#39;s words at verses 2:5-8 leave absolutely no doubt who he had in mind at verse 1:10ff. The Father in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth; the heavens are &quot;the works of His hands&quot; (v. 1:10) and He has now appointed Jesus over these &quot;works of His hands&quot; (2:7).</p> <p>ALL from ANGELFIRE ^^^</p> <p><strong>IF you understand as new creation passage, which I DONT right now:</strong></p> <p>It is common for the writer of Hebrews to apply OT texts that formerly were applicable word for word to people like David and Solomon to Yeshua in separate applications and fulfillments and never because he&#39;s a person of their essences, of course. (2 Sam 7:14, Heb. 1:5, Ps. 45:6, Heb. 1:8) So it shouldn&#39;t be any wonder that he would do the same thing with creation scriptures because there is an old one and a new one. Well, we have, in context, the &quot;inhabited earth to come&quot; (2:9), &quot;the last days&quot; (1:2), and a &quot;kingdom&quot;(1:8), etc. How apropos considering that in the context of Psalm 102 in the LXX (which is what Hebrews is quoting), we have &ldquo;the generation to come&rdquo; and &quot;the people that shall be created&quot; (v. 18) Really, nothing more should have to be said. It&#39;s obvious Yeshua is agent of the new creation. Isaiah 51:16 sheds light. Here Yahweh says prophetically:<br /> <br /> &quot;I have put My words in your mouth and have covered you with the shadow of My hand, to establish the heavens, to found the earth, and to say to Zion, &#39;You are My people.&#39;&quot;</p> <p>HUGE not my writing.</p> <p>If the texts are about a new creation, how could such ever be &quot;changed&quot;? I think this is actually very key for understanding this passage and seeing that it is a new creation passage (Hebrews 2:5; I think this is a summary statement saying that everything up to that point is discussing the new creation). He says this statement for future generations. So, one key thing here is acknowledging the tense of the verbs.</p> <p>There are different verb tenses going on here that help bring clarity to the meaning of the text. It is not an example like Isa. 53 (he WAS despised and rejected) clearly putting a past tense on a prophecy. This is different, all of the verbs in this quotation in Hebrews 1:10-12 are in the future besides those in v. 10 which are past (laid) and present (are the works). Why this shift from past to future? Well, because this act of new creation had already been accomplished by the time of the writing of the book of Hebrews. Jesus has &quot;figuratively&quot; laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens (new creation in Christ, 2 Cor. 5), and even this creation that Jesus has inaugurated will pass away and be replaced by the everlasting kingdom. Some scholars understand Heb. 1:10-12 to be referring to the millenial kingdom that Jesus will lead, and then that kingdom will pass away and be replaced by the eternal kingdom of Rev. 21. However, that reading mistakenly throws all of the verbs into the future. They read &quot;laid&quot; and &quot;are&quot; as future, instead of as accomplished acts. Therefore, that argument does not stand.</p> <p>Ehh^^</p> <p>-------------------------------------</p> <p>Psalm 102 is discussing the everlasting kingdom, so when we arrive at Heb. 1:10-12, we should expect the author to be using Psa. 102 in this way. This is exactly what we observe.</p> <p>The author of Hebrews&rsquo; point in Heb. 1:10 is not to say that Jesus created the heavens and the earth. This becomes clear when looking at the emphasis of the quotation and the context of Psa. 102. When looking at this quotation&rsquo;s emphasis, 2/3 of the quote concerns the temporality of creation and how it will pass away (Heb. 1:11-12) and 1/3 of the quote concerns the creation of the world. In context Psalm 102 is clearly discussing the eternality of God&#39;s future kingdom. Psalm 102:3-11 is discussing David&#39;s temporality, that his days are like a shadow and that he withers away like the grass (Psa. 102:11). Psalm 102:12 contrasts David with God who is enthroned forever. The temporality of David&#39;s days contrasted with the eternality of God&#39;s days is contrasted again in Psalm 102:24. This is the verse directly preceding our text (Psalm 102:25-27). Therefore, it is clear that the context of this quote in Psalm 102:25-27 deals with the eternality of God in opposition to the fading away of all other things.</p> <p>Not only would this be the only place that this is taught (embedded in an OT quotation) but why does the author go on to quote Psalm 102:26-27 along with v. 25? Why wouldn&rsquo;t the author of Hebrews just quote Psalm 102:25 and then stop? Because the creation of the world is not the purpose of this quotation. The purpose is to show the eternality of God&rsquo;s kingdom even over the physical creation which is temporal and will &ldquo;wear out&rdquo;.</p> <p>There is another problem with using Hebrews 1:10 to say that Jesus is the creator of the world. Namely, that by doing so, you are making Jesus = The Father, and Trinitarians do not want to do this. In context, the OT quotation is referring to the Father, because consistently throughout the OT, the Father is the only one credited with the creation of all things (Gen. 1:1; Psa. 121:2). There is no possible way to reasonably believe that Psa. 102:25 was referencing Jesus, and luckily, most scholars would agree that Psa. 102:25 is in reference to the Father. So, therefore, it is poor exegesis to say, &ldquo;Look, in Hebrews, Lord is referring to Jesus, but that exact same Lord in the Psalms is the Father!&rdquo; Let me clarify why.</p> <p>You have to understand, it is not simply calling Jesus God, it is calling Jesus the Father, this is something Trinitarians overlook.</p> <p>Two different people can&rsquo;t be credited with the exact same thing. Even with the case of the abomination of desolation. The bible speaks of two different abomination of desolations (Antiochus epiphanies ez. 36 and Titus Matt. 24) yet they are desolating two different things! They both are not credited with doing the exact same abominations. In the same way, we cannot credit Jesus with the exact same act as the Father. Since the text uses the singular, one being created the world. Our theology cannot lead us to think that both Jesus and God created the world, in that case it should say &ldquo;Lords&rdquo;.</p> <p>This understanding also fits better with the context of Hebrews 1:7. Since we have established that verse 7 is discussing the temporality of angels(see MAKE angels, the verb clarifies this meaning, the verse doesn&rsquo;t say angels are winds, but that God MAKES them winds), this helps clarify the contrast being made in vv 8-12. It makes no sense to say, angels are temporary BUT Jesus created the world! No, this is not a contrasting argument. However it does make sense to say that angels are temporary, but Jesus and his kingdom are eternal. This is what we see in vv 7-12.<br /> In this whole section Jesus is being contrasted as superior to angels.<br /> <br /> It makes no sense to say:<br /> V.7 angels are temporary BUT<br /> V.8-9 Jesus reign is eternal<br /> AND<br /> V.10-12 Jesus created the world.<br /> <br /> Yes that would mean jesus was superior to angels, but it does not fit well at all with the flow of the argument. But it does make sense to say:<br /> <br /> V.7 angels are temporary BUT<br /> V.8-9 Jesus&rsquo; reign is eternal<br /> AND<br /> V.10-12 Jesus&rsquo; kingdom will outlast even the creation</p> <p>How is this in reference to the son? Because the new garment of v. 11 is the new creation, which Jesus has initiated and will reign over.</p> <p>In other words the angels are like a flaming fire (which goes out) and winds (which go away) like the old garment that will be rolled up (v. 11), but Jesus and his Kingdom will remain forever.</p> <p>New Creation argument which i dont buy because it says it will pass away :</p> <ol start="2" type="1"> <li>Note the &ldquo;latter-day&rdquo; context of the whole chapter after 1:1. Because of that, the &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; here and the creation (1:10) are best taken as the beginning of the new era, and Jesus&rsquo;s &ldquo;new creation.&rdquo;</li> <li>it is because of his exaltation that Jesus has become superior to the angels (1:4), this is the context for these quotes in Hebrews 1:5-13.</li> <li>Immediately after the 1:10-12 quote is 1:13 in which Jesus is exalted to the right hand of God, again exaltation is the context.</li> <li>Hebrews 2:5 says that the subject matter is the &ldquo;world to come&rdquo; not the old creation.</li> </ol>'),

(41, 1, 58, 9, 23, 1, null, 99, null, '<p>NEW:</p> <p>I was looking some more at Heb. 9:23 and reading anything I could find on it. I came across one author who referenced Heb. 3:6 which speaks of Christians as God&#39;s house, or God&#39;s dwelling place, which is also reiterated in other places such as Eph. 2. But I think this is important for our discussion because it shows that Christians are the place where God dwells, Christians are God&#39;s sanctuary, even in the mind of the author of Hebrews. This verse connects a heavenly location (the house of God, 3:6) with people. So, it is not out of the scope of the author of Hebrews, or the context, that the heavenly _____ that needed to be cleansed may in fact be Christians.</p> <p>So, even if in v. 23 the author had in mind the heavenly sanctuary, I would argue that there are likely two heavenly sanctuaries. One is the actual sanctuary that exists in the heavens, and one is Christians here on earth. God dwells in both of these places.</p> <p>The big question here is what heavenly things need sacrifices, and what sacrifices in the bible have atoned for heavenly things?</p> <p>To clarify, the phrase reads in the greek lit. &ldquo;the heavenly __ themselves&rdquo; but we need to supply an object in english, this is the conundrum, what is the referrent here?</p> <p>There are three main possible interpretations for how to understand what the heavenly things/ones are. They could be heavenly objects such as the temple that exists in heaven (Heb. 8:5), they could be heavenly beings such as angels, or they could be humans. All of these options are possible grammatically as it could refer to plural persons or plural objects, however, I believe that this passage is referring to humans because that seems to be the only biblical option.</p> <p>Contextually, this passage makes clear that the better &ldquo;sacrifices&rdquo; being referred to here in v. 23 is likely the sacrifice of Jesus. In Hebrews 9:12-14; 15; 24; 26; 28 the author is discussing the new covenant through Christ&rsquo;s blood. Surrounding all around the passage in question is the atonement of Jesus and its superiority to the old covenant sacrifices. We do not have to guess as to which &ldquo;sacrifices&rdquo; were better, it is littered throughout the context.</p> <p>If Christ&rsquo;s is the better sacrifice being referred to here in v. 23 then this helps illuminate and eliminate some interpretive options. Let&rsquo;s discuss option one, that the &ldquo;heavenly things&rdquo; are objects in heaven. The first glaring problem is that nothing in heaven needs cleansing. God dwells in the temple in heaven (Heb. 9:11; 24; Acts 17:24; Hab. 2:20), and God&rsquo;s temple is repeatedly called holy (Psa. 11:4; Jon. 2:7). Therefore, we should not expect sin to be present there and we should not expect it to need purification or cleansing with sacrifices (Heb. 9:23). This heavenly temple likely welcomes the full presence of God, with no impediments due to sin, so what would need to be sprinkled with blood, or better blood? It simply does not make sense.</p> <p>Now to our second interpretive option. If one wants to assume that somehow angels have sinned and they are the ones who need to be cleansed with sacrifices, this concept would be brand new to scripture. It would be complete opinion, nowhere in scripture is there mention of angels receiving atonement, or Jesus&rsquo; atonement being efficacious for angels. Scripture only speaks of angels being held in chains until judgement for their sin (2 Pet. 2:4), and Jesus&rsquo; atonement is efficacious for humans because he was a human, it was substitutionary. Jesus was not an angel so there is no reason to assume that his atonement is anyway efficacious for angels. None of these conjections are anywhere in scripture so it is safe to rule out this option as being unlikely.</p> <p>As mentioned above, I believe that we are missing the mark by translating this phrase as &ldquo;heavenly things&rdquo;, we are supplying the &ldquo;things&rdquo; here which is not in the greek. However, this could just as easily be referring to persons. I think that what is being referred to here is not heavenly objects, but heavenly people, ultimately, Christians.</p> <p>Christians in the New Testament are referred to as &ldquo;heavenly&rdquo; multiple times. Perhaps the most blatant reference to Christians as heavenly is in 1 Corinthians 15:48 in which Christians are explicitly called heavenly or &ldquo;of heaven&rdquo;. Christians have a heavenly calling (Heb. 3:1), a heavenly gift (Heb. 6:4), and have come to the heavenly Jerusalem (Heb. 12:22). Therefore, it would not be strange for the author of Hebrews to refer to Christians as &ldquo;heavenly ones&rdquo;.</p> <p>If &ldquo;heavenly&rdquo; is referring to Christians then this fits perfectly with the surrounding context which discusses the New Covenant through Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice for sins bringing redemption. In both Hebrews 9:14 and 9:24 the author specifies that Christ&rsquo;s atonement is for &ldquo;our&rdquo; sins. Who is the &ldquo;our&rdquo; referring to? 1<sup>st</sup> Century Christians. Contextually, Christ&rsquo;s atonement was for those who would believe in him, not for angels or for the heavenly temple. So, why should we interpret Hebrews 9:23 any differently?</p> <p>The common way to refer to something in the location of heaven is to say &ldquo;in the heavens&rdquo; (ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις), or something similar like earlier in verse 23 which says (ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς) however this key preposition ἐν is absent from the second half of Hebrews 9:23, this suggests that the author of Hebrews is not referencing something physically located in the heavens. If the author of Hebrews was attempting to identify something or objects located in heaven we would expect him to keep that exact same phrasing that he used in the first half of the verse. Something like, &ldquo;It was necessary for the copies of the things in heaven to be cleansed with these sacrifices, but the things in heaven themselves with better sacrifices than these.&rdquo; Did you catch the difference? The author removes the &ldquo;in&rdquo; from the second half of the sentence. I think this is done purposefully to show the reader that he is no longer referencing something that exists in heaven but is heavenly, namely, Christians. When paired with the two arguments above, it becomes clearer and clearer that the most likely referrent here in v. 23 is Christians.</p> <p>Overall, it is perfectly reasonable grammatically and highly likely contextually that &ldquo;the heavenly __ themselves&rdquo; should be translated as &ldquo;the heavenly ones themselves&rdquo; in reference to Christians. Christ&rsquo;s atonement is the better sacrifice for Christians moreso than the blood of bulls and goats which could never take away sins. What beautiful news. This is seen clearly in the entire NT, the entire Chapter 9 of Hebrews, and is also the message of v. 23.</p> <p>Hebrews 9:24 brings light to what heavenly thing is cleansed. The argument flows as follows, getting rid of the interrupting phrases: &ldquo;23but the heavenly ones themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ (entered)&hellip; into heaven itself now to appear before the face of God on our behalf.&rdquo; He does not enter into heaven to sprinkle his own blood and purify the heavenly sanctuary, but rather he goes into heaven on our behalf! Read that again, according to v. 24 Jesus did not go into heaven to purify the sanctuary but on behalf of the Christian, he put away sin by the sacrifice of himself (Heb. 9:26).</p> <p>Ask Jerry, what is the metaphor refering to? If you want to say this is metaphorical, that is fine but what is it refering to?</p>'),

He can have either one or the other, but can&rsquo;t have both. However, ultimately, we believe that he has neither clearly calling Jesus God, because these are not hard and fast rules. The way the authors used the article depended on what they were referring to and if they were referring to something that would not be confused, there is no reason to use the second article.

The Granville Sharp rule does not apply if it is clear that the two things being discussed are different, for example, with gold and silver. We non-Trinitarians assert that there was no ambiguity in the minds of the first-century readers between God and Jesus. They were known to be different from each other. Because no ambiguity between Christ and God would arise in the minds of the readers if the second article was omitted, it can be (and was) omitted without a problem. Likewise, there was no need for a second article in Matthew 21:12 in the phrase, &ldquo;all the [ones] selling and buying,&rdquo; or in Ephesians 2:20 in the phrase, &ldquo;the apostles and prophets,&rdquo; because no one would ever think that &ldquo;sold&rdquo; and &ldquo;bought&rdquo; meant the same thing, or that &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; and &ldquo;prophets&rdquo; were somehow the same office. This sort of distinction is apparent in numerous passages throughout the Bible.</p> <p>The limitations and exceptions to the rule stated by him are as follows: In this case, then, it appears that the article is not repeated, because its repetition is not necessary to prevent ambiguity.</p> <p>2. No similar rule applies to proper names. &lsquo;The reason,&rsquo; says Middleton, &lsquo;is evident at once; for it is impossible that John and Thomas, the names of two distinct persons, should be predicated of an individual&rsquo; (p. 68).</p> <p>This remark is not to the purpose [i.e., &lsquo;is not correct&rsquo;], for the same individual may have two names. The true reason for this limitation is, that proper names, when those of the same individual, are not connected by a copulative or copulatives, and therefore that, when they are thus connected, no ambiguity arises from the omission of the article.</p> <p>5. Lastly, &lsquo;we find,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;in very many instances, not only in the plural, but even in the singular number, that where attributives are in their nature absolutely incompatible, i.e., where the application of the rule would involve a contradiction in terms, there the first attributive only has the article, the perspicuity of the passage not requiring the rule to be accurately observed&rsquo; (p. 92).</p>'),

So, to say that Jesus was slain &ldquo;from the foundation of the world&rdquo;, or over a period of time (the history of the world) is quite strange. Also, the exact parallel of Revelation 13:8 and Revelation 17:8 &ldquo;written in the book of life from the foundation of the world&rdquo; lends support to understanding the phrase &ldquo;from the foundation of the world&rdquo; to refer to believer&rsquo;s being written in the book of life.</p> <p>Although there are certainly some things, like the Church and the Savior (Eph. 1:4; 1 Pet. 1:20) that were in the mind of God <em>before</em> the foundation of the world, each individual being written in the book of life did not occur &ldquo;before&rdquo; the foundation of the world because Revelation 17:8 along with Revelation 13:8 makes clear that these individuals being written in the book of Life occurs &ldquo;from&rdquo; the foundation of the world, in other words, from Genesis to the present day.</p> <p>This verse, Revelation 13:8, and Revelation 17:8 provide support for the doctrine of Open Theism, that God does not know the future exhaustively, thus, it makes sense why the scriptures would say that believers are written into the book of life progressively throughout history, instead of every person being written down in the book before Genesis, before they existed. We would say the reason why each individual is not written down before they existed is because God did not know exactly how each individual would live their life because our lives had not happened yet, and he gives us the free will to accept or reject him in this life. (For more information on God&rsquo;s foreknowledge see Appendix 8: On Calvinism and Predestination)</p> <p>Some theologians like the translation as the ESV, &ldquo;written before the foundation of the world in the book of life,&rdquo; because it is more clearly espousing the Calvinist doctrine that people&rsquo;s names are written in the book of life before the foundation of the world, i.e., God predestines them either to salvation or damnation long before they are born. After all, if people&rsquo;s names are written in the book of life before the foundation of the world, then God knows, and even determines, the fate of every person. This is not what Scripture teaches. God gives each person free will to make his or her own choices. God wants all people to be saved (1 Tim. 2:4), and we are the ones who decide whether we are saved or not.</p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>'),

During Pentecost in A.D. 66, Josephus and Tacitus record what appears to be the departure from the Temple of the seven angels with the seven bowls. Immediately thereafter, the Jewish War began. During this war the seas and rivers turned red with blood as predicted in the second and third bowls. A multitude of miraculous signs were witnessed in A.D. 69, one year before the climactic siege of Jerusalem in fulfillment of Revelation 16:14: &ldquo;They are spirits of demons performing miraculous signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle . . . .&rdquo; Amidst these miraculous signs, the kings of the east, Sohaemus and Antiochus, crossed the Euphrates to meet the other Roman forces near Mt. Megiddo (Armageddon)as indicated in Revelation 16:12 and 16. During this time a great thunderstorm and earthquake simultaneously rocked Jerusalem while both Rome and Jerusalem were divided by separate and concurrent three-way civil wars as predicted in the seventh bowl in Revelation 16:18-19: &ldquo;Then there came flashes of lightening, rumblings, peals of thunder and a severe earthquake. . . .

However, this is not the way that we should understand this phrase. As we attempt to figure out what this phrase means a distinction between the phrase &ldquo;from the foundation of the world&rdquo; and &ldquo;before the foundation of the world&rdquo; is needed.</p> <p>Often interpreters will understand these two phrases to be synonomous, in other words, &ldquo;from the foundation of the world&rdquo; and &ldquo;before the foundation of the world&rdquo; both mean before Genesis. However, when looking at occurances of these two phrases they clearly have different meanings. &ldquo;<strong>Before</strong> the foundation of the world indicates <strong>before</strong> Genesis, whereas <strong>from</strong> the foundation of the world indicates <strong>from</strong> Genesis to present&rdquo; (Soteriology101.com). Let us see some examples that show &ldquo;from the foundation of the the world&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;before the foundation of the world.&rdquo;</p> <ul> <li>Luke 11:50 (ESV) &ndash; &ldquo;so that the blood of all the prophets, shed <strong>from the foundation of the world</strong>, may be charged against this generation, 51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.&rdquo;</li> </ul> <p>This is ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου &ldquo;from the foundation of the world&rdquo;, clearly meaning from Genesis to the present day, no blood of the prophets was shed before Genesis 1.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Hebrews 9:25-26 (ESV) &ndash; &ldquo;Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enter the holy places every year with blood not his own, 26 for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world.&rdquo;</p> </li> </ul> <p>This is ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου &ldquo;from the foundation of the world&rdquo;, in context this is talking about paying for sins, and since no humans sinned before Genesis 1, this is clearly talking about Genesis to the present.</p> <p>More examples could be given of this but it is clear that &ldquo;from the foundation of the world&rdquo; means from Genesis to the present day. Here in Revelation 17:8 the phrase used is &ldquo;from the foundation of the world&rdquo; not &ldquo;before&rdquo;. Therefore, this verse does not teach predestination, instead it is saying that since the foundation of the world, more and more people have been written in the book of life (because they exercised faith) or they have not been written in the book of life (meaning they will not be saved).</p>'),

Nobody had defeated him, he was 100% at getting humans to sin, which brings death. But Jesus defeated Satan by living a perfect life and through his death, bringing forgiveness and life to a bunch of Sinners. Satan has been defeated. He has been bound (Mark 3:27).</p> <p>Here&rsquo;s the crux of the matter: Because Jesus is stronger than the strong man, he can offer those who trust him full and unfettered forgiveness for every sin.</p> <p>Jesus says in Mark 3 that once the strong man is bound, he can plunder all of his goods, well, what are his goods? Lost people! Now that the strong man has been bound, Jesus can save souls, and draw all men to himself (). Jesus says that the one who binds the strong man can plunder the strong man&rsquo;s house (3:27). Then he immediately says &ldquo;all sins&rdquo; and &ldquo;whatever blasphemies&rdquo; will be forgiven (except the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit) (3:28). In other words, the forgiveness explained in 3:28 is a result of Jesus&rsquo;s binding of the strong man recounted in 3:27.</p> <p>The battle with Satan isn&rsquo;t over in Mark 1 or Mark 3 (Jesus will end up sacrificing his life to establish the kingdom fully), but a decisive blow has already been dealt.</p> <p>Whereas Adam should&rsquo;ve cast out the serpent who called into question God&rsquo;s Word, Jesus overcame the Devil&mdash;and indeed bound him (cf. Rev. 20:2)&mdash;as part of his faithfulness to his messianic task.</p> <p>Adam should&rsquo;ve obeyed unto life; instead, Adam sinned and brought death. Jesus obeyed fully, even unto death, and his obedience brings everlasting life. Jesus bound the strong man through obedience to God&rsquo;s will. And only this fully obedient Savior has the authority to grant you life and forgive your sins.</p> <hr /> <p>John 12:31-32, another supporting text used by amillennialists states: &quot;NOW judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world shall be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself.&quot; this binding happened after Jesus&rsquo; resurrection!</p> <hr /> <p>Colossians 2:14&ndash;15 makes it clear what happened to the powers of evil through Christ&#39;s ministry &ndash; He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.&quot; This indicates that wicked powers were defeated in principle at the cross of Christ. When Jesus purged all of our sins on Calvary, something happened to Satan. The evil one lost his authority to keep people back from God. He was bound by what Jesus did.</p> <p>THEY USED TO HAVE THE POWER OF DEATH REIGNING OVER ALL MEN (ROM. 5) BUT JESUS CONQUERED THAT.</p> <p>I saw satan fall like lightning passage!! somehow his falling from heaven has to do with the preaching of the gospel by the apostles.</p> <hr /> <p>Revelation 12:11 testifies of the embattled saints that &quot;they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony.&quot; And Romans 8 we are more than conquerers.

Yet almost all bible scholars seem to conclude that the ἔζησαν lit. &ldquo;they lived&rdquo; occurs after the not &ldquo;worshipping&rdquo; προσεκύνησαν and not &ldquo;receiving&rdquo; ἔλαβον the beast&rsquo;s mark. There is seemingly no grammatical reason for this. What if, like the greek suggests, all four of these verbs that follow &ldquo;who&rdquo; οἵτινες are in the same time frame? So, instead of translating it &ldquo;who did not worship and did not receive the mark&hellip; came to life and reigned for 1000 years,&rdquo; we translate it, &ldquo;who did not worship the beast and did not receive the mark... and lived and reigned with Christ the 1000 years.&rdquo; What if the living and reigning happened before the non-worship and non-reception? When we translate it as they came to life and reigned for 1000 years, we end up translating the first two verbs as happening first, and then the second two happening after. Almost inherently adding a &ldquo;then&rdquo; they came to life. The first two verbs happen and then the second two, but grammatically there is no reason for this.</p> <p>Kik agrees with this^^ - Since they are all in the same tense they must refer to the same time. That is, the time of not worshipping the beast and not receiving his mark is the same time as that of sitting on thrones and living and reigning with Christ. J. Marcellus Kik, An Eschatology of VICTORY, (Phillipsburg, NJ: Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing CO., 1971), 228.</p> <p>Revelation 5:10 also gives more clarity to this passage. The exact same language is used. People from every nation HAVE BEEN made &ldquo;priests of God&rdquo; and they will &ldquo;reign upon the earth&rdquo;. One key insight is learned here as opposed to Rev. 20:4, is that they will reign upon the earth, not in heaven. So, to take Rev. 20:4 as souls departed from their bodies currently reigning with Christ in heaven would be a mistake. Another helpful point in Rev. 5:10 is that the priesthood is a present not a future reality. They have been made priests. This lines up very nicely with Rev. 1:6, which says that believers have been made priests, and 1 Pet. 2:5;9 which both call believers as a kingdom of Priests now.</p> <p>Problems with the Amillenial view that it is a resurrection of souls. The problem is that, that is not a resurrection at all. A physical resurrection is a resurrection of the body. If the body is still in the grave it is not a resurrection. Also the fact that Revelation 20 deals with a resurrection eliminates the interpretation that the Chapter is speaking of the intermediate state of the soul (An Eschatology of Victory, Presbyterian and Reformed, p. 230). And secondly, the Soul does not continue living after death. Souls are not immortal (See Spirit &amp; Truth Appendix).</p> <p>Problems with the Premillennial view:</p> <p>The most glaring problem with the Premillennial view is that they take this passage of visionary literature (Rev. 20:1; 4; I saw thrones&hellip; I saw the souls), and mistakenly interpret the visionary level to be the exact same as the referential level. This mistake is often made by Premillennialists in the book of Revelation.</p> <p>Let me explain this concept further. In prophetic and visionary literature the Visionary level is what John (in this case) sees in his vision. Such as an angel filling a censer with fire and throwing it on the earth (Rev. 8:5), a dragon with seven heads and ten horns sweeping down a third of the stars of heaven with his tail (Rev. 12:4) and saints who had been beheaded resurrecting and reigning with Christ for 1000 years (Rev. 20:4-5).</p> <p>Yet, what the vision depicts and what the elements represent are two very different things. John helps us understand that the visionary level and the referential level are two different things. He gives us the answer to what some of the symbols in Revelation mean, for example, the dragon represents the Adversary Satan (Rev. 12:9), the ten horns represent ten kings (Rev. 17:12), and seven heads are the seven mountains (Rev. 17:9). These clarifying statements also occur in Revelation 1:20; 4:5; and 5:6, how many times does John have to explain his visions for us to understand that they point to something else? Clearly John doesn&rsquo;t want his readers to interpret his visions &ldquo;literally&rdquo;. These symbols represent something other than the symbol itself, so if we find ourselves interpreting an entire vision &ldquo;literally&rdquo; we are in reality denying the presence of symbolism at all.</p> <p>This is where the Premillennial view falls short in interpreting Revelation 20:4-6. They fail to understand that it is a vision. The premillennialist tries to interpret Revelation as &ldquo;literally&rdquo; as possible until it is simply infeasible or John explicitly gives us what the vision is referring to (Rev. 12:9; 17:9-12). However, this is not how we should be reading prophetic literature! That is how we read the rest of the New Testament, that is not how we should read literature that is filled with visions and symbols. Sometimes Revelation itself even calls these visions &ldquo;signs&rdquo; (Rev. 12:1; 15:1) which are things that point to a greater reality. The mistake of the Premillennial is they read visions such as Revelation 12 in which a woman is clothed with the sun and understand that she could not literally be clothed with the sun, so they rightly see it as a metaphor. However, when it comes to visions which are theoretically possible (such as Rev. 20:4-6), they get lulled into thinking that it is not a vision anymore, but that we should be interpreting it literally. This is simply mis-diagnosing the genre, John clearly states that the section of Revelation 20:4-6 is a vision, so why would we read it with our &ldquo;literal&rdquo; glasses on instead of with our symbolic and prophetic glasses. I think the Premillennialist is wearing the wrong glasses when reading Revelation 20:4-6.</p> <p>What I propose is happening in these verses is a &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; resurrection like is talked about in the gospels. Revelation 20:4-6 is a physical picture of spiritual resurrection. Just as the prostitute riding a dragon is a physical picture of a spiritual reality of unfaithful Israel following Satan instead of God. This passage is depicting a physical resurrection but it is referring to the spiritual resurrection (John 5:25), the coming to spiritual life by the Christian saints (Eph. 2:5), to live spiritually and reign with Christ for a very long time (Eph. 2:6; Rev. 5:10), a &ldquo;1000 years&rdquo;, which aligns nicely with other NT passages on the Spiritual life of the believer.</p> <p>It is also worth noting that the verb in v. 4 is came to life ζαο, not αναστασις which is usually the term for resurrection. So, physical resurrection is likely not in view here. Bodies are not being resurrected. More evidence for this is that John uses the term souls ψυχη, not σαρζ the flesh, or σομα typically translated body.</p> <p>BIG The view held by Augustine, who saw the reign spoken of in this passage as &ldquo;the spiritual reign of believers on earth in the present age, symbolizing the victory through which it is written that &ldquo;we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us (Romans 8:37).&rdquo;</p> <p>Who are the &ldquo;they&rdquo; who are seated on the thrones? The subject is Christ and his armies described in Rev. 19:11-21, as these are the only people remaining in the vision.</p>'),

The features of Ezek 38:18&ndash;22 can be seen in 16:17&ndash;21 as John links the earth-shattering quake (vv 18 , 20 ; Ezek 38:19&ndash;20 ) with the collapse of all the world&rsquo;s cities (v 19 ; cf.

When we see the noun πόλεμος with the definite article in 20:8 , the article&rsquo;s presence makes it all but impossible to avoid the conclusion that the battle mentioned in 20:8 is the one previously described in 19:19 and in 16:14 . This observation is made all the more impressive when we notice that 16:14 ; 19:19 ; and 20:8 contain the last three uses of the noun πόλεμος in Revelation and, at that, the only uses accompanied by the article. Thus, we have firm ground on which to argue that in 20:8 John is repeating his previous accounts of the final battle in 19:19 and 16:14 .</p> <p>4. John uses precisely the same wording he uses in connection with the Armageddon revolt in 16:14 and virtually the same wording he uses in 19:19 (N.B. 16:14 , συναγαγειν ατος ες τν πόλεμον , &ldquo;to gather them for the battle&rdquo;; 19:19 , συνηγμένα ποιησαι τν πόλεμον , &ldquo;gathered to wage the battle&rdquo;; 20:8 , συναγαγειν ατος εις τν πόλεμον , &ldquo;to gather them for the battle&rdquo;).</p>'),

In the same way, The camp that is surrounded in Revelation is the church, the camp of the saints, before they enter into the New Jerusalem.</p> <p>Look, overall, it would have been infinitely clearer for John to call this &ldquo;beloved city&rdquo; the New Jerusalem, and their would have been no confusion.

Therefore, New Jerusalem cannot literally be surrounded by a literal siege. But this scene does depict God&rsquo;s people gathered into one group, and all of the nations outside of Christ gathered into one group.

BDAG). The word only occurs here and in 1 Corinthians 5:11 of a person who is verbally abusive, although other forms of the word that occur in the New Testament are loidoreō(the verb) and loidoria (the feminine noun for verbal abuse or insults).</p> <p>Christians must be especially careful not to be verbally abusive because it is a serious sin and our modern culture abounds with it and influences us. For example, on social media and in email, people say all kinds of horrible, and often untrue, things about each other. But God and Jesus do not care about our modern culture. The ancient cultures were verbally abusive too (thus the existence of the word in ancient Greek), and believers were not to get involved with it. As we see here in 1 Corinthians 6:10, making a practice of being verbally abusive can cost a believer rewards in the coming kingdom of Christ.</p> <p>That believers are not to be verbally abusive, and that it is a serious sin, is not new. Jesus sternly warned his followers about being verbally abusive and making verbal judgments about others, for example, not to call others &ldquo;You no-good&rdquo; (&ldquo;Fool&rdquo; in many versions&mdash;Matt. 5:22), which is a somewhat poor modern translation of what in the Aramaic and biblical culture had the deeper meaning of a godless person who rebelled against God.</p> <p>The proper Christian response to being verbally abused is to bless the person (1 Cor. 4:12) and ignore the attack and move on (1 Pet. 2:23). We should imitate the behavior Jesus exemplified when he was on trial (Matt. 26:63; John 18:23). Christians are to work diligently to have pure, kind hearts, and to speak words of blessing. We can be honest with one another, but we are to do that honestly and kindly, and always ask ourselves if what we want to say needs to be said at all.</p> <p>Jesus taught us that out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks (Matt. 12:34; 15:18). If a person finds it hard (or impossible) to not revile others when hurt or insulted, that is a sign that the person needs to have their heart healed. There is no excuse for living with an unforgiving, bitter heart that causes the mouth to sin. Healing the heart and forgiving ourselves and others may not be easy, but it is part of the work that believers must do to live godly lives.</p>'),

For more than 3000 years, God&rsquo;s people have turned to the Psalms in times of rejoicing and great trouble. The psalmists give us words to praise an awesome, wonderful God. When we are distracted or worried, the Psalms remind us of our mighty, loving God Who we serve. When our grief is so great we cannot pray, the cries of the psalmists put words to our pain.</p> <p>The Psalms are comforting because they focus our attention on Yahweh God, our loving Father and faithful Shepherd, and the truth that He is still on the throne&mdash; the One and Only True God, none is more powerful than Him. The Psalms reassure us that no matter what we are feeling or experiencing, God is with us, and God is good, all the time.</p> <p>WHO WROTE THE PSALMS? The Book of 150 Psalms is a collection of Hebrew poetry that was originally sung in worship to God with music instruments.</p> <p>Most Psalms identify the writer at the top of the page. These Psalm introductions on the Hebrew scrolls may be considered authoritative (according to John Schoenheit and other scholars). The writers had holy spirit upon them and God was the Author. The Psalms were not written by a single writer, but were written by at least 6 different men over about 5 centuries.</p> <p>Moses wrote one psalm, Psalm 90, &ldquo;A Prayer of Moses, the man of God.&rdquo; It is the oldest Psalm.</p> <p>About 450 years later King Solomon wrote two psalms: Psalm 72, &ldquo;Of Solomon&rdquo; and Psalm 127, &ldquo;A Song of Ascents Of Solomon.&rdquo;</p> <p>David is named the writer of 73 Psalms. 50 Psalms do not mention an author (Ps 90 for example) however, most scholars agree that David may have written some of these, also.</p> <p>Asaph wrote 12 Psalms (for example: Ps 73 &ldquo;Book III. A Psalm of Asaph.&rdquo; &amp; Ps 77 &ldquo;For the Musical Director. To Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.&rdquo;)</p> <p>The Sons of Korah wrote 11 Psalms (for example: Ps 84 &ldquo;For the Musical Director. On an instrument of Gath. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.&rdquo;).</p> <p>Heman wrote Psalm 88 in concert with the Sons of Korah, &ldquo;A Song. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. For the Musical Director. To be sung in a depressed voice. A contemplation of Heman the Ezrahite.&rdquo;</p> <p>Ethan wrote Psalm 89, &ldquo;A contemplation of Ethan the Ezrahite.&rdquo;</p> <p>Commentary on Psalm 90:1-f &amp; Book IV of Psalms</p> <p>Ps 90:1 O Lord, you have been our refuge from generation to generation.</p> <p>Psalm 90 is entitled: &ldquo;A Prayer by Moses, the man of God.&rdquo; This is the only psalm attributed to Moses. Psalm 90 is the oldest psalm, written by Moses by the year 1440 BC. About 450 years later King Solomon wrote two psalms: Psalm 72 and Psalm 127.</p> <p>Psalm 90 marks the beginning of &ldquo;Book IV&rdquo; of Psalms (Psalms 90-106).. The arrangement of Psalms into five books goes back at least to when the Hebrew Scriptures were translated into Greek (the Septuagint) about 250-200 B.C.</p> <p>Psalm 90 is categorized as a community lament&ndash;&ndash;a psalm expressing the pain of the worshiping community and crying out for relief, forgiveness, restoration. It speaks of judgment imposed by Yahweh on the people. It refers to the experiences of the Israelites during the Exodus, when Yahweh punished them for their unfaithfulness.</p> <p>Commentary on &amp; Book IV of Psalms</p> <p>Book IV (Psalms 90-106) looks back to the time of Moses and the Exodus. Book IV has key words: &ldquo;our iniquities, afflicted us, we have seen evil, destructive pestilence, plague, terror by night, vengeance, wilderness&rdquo; and these following key verses:</p> <p>Ps 95:8-11 Do not harden your heart, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness, when your fathers tested Me, they tried Me, though they had seen My work. For forty years I was disgusted at that generation and said, &ldquo;They are a people whose heart wanders astray. And they do not know My roads.&rdquo; Therefore I swore in My anger, &ldquo;They will never enter into My rest.&rdquo;</p> <p>Ps 96:5 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh made the heavens.</p> <p>Ps 98:1 Sing to Yahweh a new song, for He has done wonderful things! His right hand and His holy arm have worked salvation for Him.</p> <p>Ps 99:5-9 Exalt Yahweh our God and worship at His footstool! He is Holy!<br /> Moses and Aaron were among His priests, and Samuel was among those who called upon His name; they repeatedly called upon Yahweh and He answered them. He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. They kept His testimonies and the statute He gave them.<br /> O Yahweh our God, You answered them; You are a forgiving God to them, but an avenger upon their deeds.<br /> Exalt Yahweh our God! Yes, worship at His holy hill, for Yahweh our God is holy.</p> <p>Selah. [Pause and consider]</p>'),

After farmers harvest corn, in September and October I see many herds of deer in those fields grazing at night. After snow melts in March/April I never see deer grazing in those fields. There is only one time of year for Bethlehem shepherds to be night-watching their sheep in the fields.</p> <p>Where were the shepherds?</p> <p>Luke 2:8 And there were shepherds in the same region, living out in the [harvested crop] fields and keeping night-watch over their flock.</p> <p>The root of αγραυλουντες (agraulountes), the original Greek word translated &ldquo;living out in the fields&rdquo; (Luke 2:8), is αγρος (agros), which refers to a field cultivated for agriculture. So the shepherds were night-watching their flock while living in crop fields that were harvested.</p> <p>Why is that significant?<br /> Shepherds with flocks of sheep would not enter crop fields during Winter, Spring or Summer. Winter was too cold for sleeping outside at night. lest the sheep eat the crops, the Spring soil could be too muddy/moist for sheep. So the time of the year when shepherds and their sheep could enter and stay in these crop fields was the in the Fall, after the Summer harvest, when farmers invited the shepherds into their fields with their flocks so that the sheep can &ldquo;clean&rdquo; their fields by eating the straw and them fertilizing the field with manure.</p> <p>This means that Jesus was born in the Fall (September/October), not in Summer, not in Winter (December), and not in Spring (March/April).</p> <p>What month in the Fall?<br /> Mary&#39;s pregnancy began during the &ldquo;sixth month&rdquo; (Luke 1:36) of Elizabeth&#39;s pregnancy, which began just after her husband Zacharias, who was of the &ldquo;division of Abijah&rdquo; (Luke 1:5) had performed his duties of &ldquo;priesthood&rdquo; in the &ldquo;sanctuary of the Lord&rdquo; (Luke 1:9). The division of Abijah performed its priestly duties in the temple during the latter half of the fourth month in the Jewish calendar, which starts after Passover. Since Passover is in March/April of our Gregorian calendar, Elizabeth conceived in June/July (fourth month from March/April), and Mary conceived in December/January (sixth month from June/July). And since &ldquo;the days were fulfilled for her to give birth&rdquo; (Luke 2:6), Mary gave birth at full term, so Jesus was born about nine months thereafter in September/October.</p> <p>According to the book by Earnest L. Martin, The Star of Bethlehem: The Star That Astonished the World, Jesus was born on September 11 (Tishri 1), 3 B.C. about 7 pm.</p>'),

Nevertheless, the Lord recognizes their efforts and they will be called &ldquo;the sons of God&rdquo; in the Kingdom, where they will live forever.

In this context, &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;because of their righteousness&rdquo; refers to both a believer&rsquo;s righteous standing in the sight of God and the righteous acts that they do. The primary emphasis of &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; in this verse is &ldquo;righteous acts,&rdquo; because it is the righteous acts of godly people that draws the attention of ungodly people and incites them to persecute the godly. Thus, in that sense this verse is very similar to 2 Timothy 3:12, that everyone who lives a godly life will be persecuted. Also, however, on a spiritual level, the Devil and his people cannot be at peace with people who have a right standing in the sight of God (are spiritually &ldquo;righteous&rdquo;) and so persecute them for that reason also. Many verses show that those people who endure persecution will be blessed for their stand for the Lord (cp. 1 Pet. 4:12-16; Rev. 2:10;</p> <p>[For more on &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; having the meaning of doing what is right or just (&ldquo;justice&rdquo;), see commentary on Matt. 5:6.

It is unlikely that John starts out to change the Hebrew Theological world view by now saying there is an additional God who is also with God and Like God. This would have been ludicrious to the Jews. It is nonsensical to state that the concept of the Trinity was in the Old Testament but not &quot;seen&quot; or understood by the Hebrews. To believe so is to make a mockery of the way in which God revealed himself to his people.</p> <p>The circumlutionary use of the Word enabled the Hebrews to avoid speaking &quot;Yahweh.&quot; Yahweh becomes the Word in the post exilic commentary and on into the targums. Of equal importance, The inspired Word of God describes the very nature of God who is otherwise largely &quot;unknown.&quot; While creation might declare the glory of God, his Word characterises his nature, purpose and intent in his relationship with man. God inspires man to record those things that express the mind of the One True God who is called the Word. Therefore the Word is with God and God is like his word.</p> <p>In the beginning reflects the link with creation. In the beginning can refer to any time reference point.

Let no man despise thy youth.</p> <p>1Tim 4 (ESV)<br /> &nbsp;</p> <p>12 Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.</p> <p>13 Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching.</p> <p>14 Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you by prophecy when the council of elders laid their hands on you.</p> <p>15 Practice these things, immerse yourself in them,fn so that all may see your progress.</p> <p>16 Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers.</p> <p>2 TIM 1:6-</p> <p>For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God that is in you through the laying on of my hands.</p> <p>&ldquo;For this reason.&rdquo; The Greek phrase, di ēn aitian (Δι᾽ ἣν αἰτίαν; the lemma: διά ὅς αἰτία) means &ldquo;for this reason,&rdquo; and encompasses everything in the long sentence that precedes it (2 Tim. 1:3-5 are one sentence in the Greek text). In modern English we would usually say, &ldquo;For these reasons&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;For this reason,&rdquo; making it seem like just one reason when it is actually several reasons. Because of Paul&rsquo;s prayers, and because of the sincere trust that lived inside Timothy, the kind of trust that both his grandmother and mother had, Timothy should not let the gift of God, his ministry, go dormant, but rather should fan it into flames. Yes, Paul was in jail and about to be executed. Yes, the people in Asia (where Timothy was) had turned away from Paul (and thus Timothy also). Yes, times were tough and dangerous. Nevertheless, God gave believers His gift of holy spirit, and with it power, love, and self-control. Therefore Timothy should not be timid or cowardly but should fan his gift into flames and do the work of an evangelist and see if anyone was still willing to hear and obey the message.</p> <p>We should note that Paul told Timothy to fan his trust into flames, heating up his commitment to God. So 2 Timothy 1:6 shows us that it is our responsibility, not God&rsquo;s, to get ourselves excited about the things of God. The difficulties of life can cool us off concerning the Good News, but it is our responsibility to take those coals and fan them back into a burning flame for the Lord.</p> <p>&ldquo;that is in you through the laying on of my hands.&rdquo; This verse is very easy to misunderstand because many people think that it is referring to a gift ministry (charisma; #5486 χάρισμα) being somehow conferred by Paul laying on his hands. But in this case, it is not the gift that is being given, but it would be understood in the culture that it is the authority and recognition to publicly minister, along with a blessing, that is being given. This then subsequently led to the person being in charge of a church or churches.</p> <p>The Bible makes it clear that each person has a gift from God (Rom. 12:6; Eph. 4:7-8). No one needs to have a person or a group to lay hands on him or her in order to confer a ministry. In fact, a ministry cannot be conferred that way; they are given by God, not conferred by people. The laying on of hands by the elders is a public recognition of a ministry in operation in the Body of Christ, and it is important for the proper order and continuation of the Church. The public ceremony of laying on of hands lets all the people know that a group of elders whom they trust and follow put their trust in this new and upcoming leader. William Mounce writes: &ldquo;There is nothing in the context of these three passages [1 Tim. 1:18; 4:14; 2 Tim. 1:6] to suggest that we have here a sacramental act whereby &lsquo;the grace of the office is transferred&rsquo;&hellip;The Spirit showed that Timothy was equipped for ministry, and in accordance with custom this fact was publicly recognized by the leadership of the community. The predominant note is not one of authority transferred or of the importation of an official status, but of a blessing given.&rdquo; (Word Biblical Commentary: Pastoral Epistles. Excursus: Prophecies about Timothy, p. 72).</p> <p>At some point in his life, Timothy was ordained to ministry by Paul and other elders (1 Tim. 4:14), and Paul exhorted him to live his life and war his warfare according to his calling in the Body of Christ (1 Tim. 1:18).</p> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" id="yui-gen4" style="caret-color: rgb(39, 39, 39); color: rgb(39, 39, 39); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 20px; width: 378px;"> <tbody id="yui-gen3"> <tr id="yui-gen2"> <td class="v1Col" id="yui-gen1" style="border: 0px solid rgb(43, 43, 43); line-height: 30px; vertical-align: text-top; width: 378px; max-width: 48%; overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word; -webkit-hyphens: auto;"></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="v1Col" style="border: 0px solid rgb(43, 43, 43); line-height: 30px; vertical-align: text-top; width: 378px; max-width: 48%; overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word; -webkit-hyphens: auto;"></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>'),

A malakos is pejorative about a person not fitting into the norm of how a male should be or act. It does not necessarily mean homosexuality, it is to be considered something like &ldquo;a sissy, or sissy boy&rdquo;. It does more reflect the patriarcal view of male dominance. It also likens malakoi with women. A woman is in like manner inferior to the male in many cultures even today. As to the sexual act, the belief in ancient times was that it is the man that solely procreates, the woman is but his field to plow his seed in. So, if he plows his seed into another male, that means he uses the male as a woman for his own pleasure. Again if you say that malakos is a boy, or young man that is kept as a sex slave for his owner to do with what he pleases, it does not mean it is volutary on the malakos side, as the so called malakos might be heterosexual, but has no choice but to comply or be punished. Hence, if you want to make malakos into a homosexual in your translation, maybe you should add something like &ldquo;willing or consenting&rdquo; to the word homosexual, or use the same type of metafor and translate with a pejorative word, like &ldquo;poof&rdquo;, &ldquo;sissy&rdquo; etc, which in my opinion would be even better. In that way it consolidates the patriarcal view of both ancient and today&rsquo;s world.</p> <p>As to the arsenokoites, that is a reference to the Torah, a man sleeping with a man as with a woman, and has nothing whatsoever to do with homosexuality. Even straight men engage in same sex activities, have always done so and will always do so. For some men it does not matter who the recepient is. Their main interest is just to sexually relieve themselves, whether it be of sadistic nature or convenience. They do not consider themselves homosexual nor act in any effeminate way, nor are they perverted &ndash; they might have families and kids of their own. Again this patriarcal view of male dominance &ndash; a man can do what he wants being the dominant. Hence for arsenokoites, do not interpret into it what it is not, rather render it for what it is. Arsenokoites is a man that sleeps with another man as with a woman, or a male that has intercourse with another man or with other men, whether it be voluntary, dominant, sadistic, convenient or any other way and only serves as a way to release sexual tension.</p>'),

Before writing this epistle, Paul had been released from his two-year imprisonment (house arrest) in Rome and was likely traveling widely, visiting regions where he had previously established branches of the Church (see Bible Dictionary, &ldquo;Pauline Epistles&rdquo;).</p> <p>To Whom Was It Written and Why?</p> <p>Paul wrote this epistle to Timothy, who had served with Paul during his second missionary journey (see Acts 16:1&ndash;3). Following their mission, Timothy continued to be a faithful missionary and Church leader (see Acts 19:22; Philippians 2:19) and one of Paul&rsquo;s most trusted associates (see 1 Corinthians 4:17). Paul referred to Timothy as his &ldquo;own son in the faith&rdquo; (1 Timothy 1:2). Timothy&rsquo;s father was a Greek Gentile, but he had a righteous Jewish mother and grandmother who had taught him and helped him learn the scriptures (see Acts 16:1; 2 Timothy 1:5; 3:15).</p> <p>At the time this epistle was written, Timothy was serving as a Church leader in Ephesus (see 1 Timothy 1:3). Paul hinted that some members doubted Timothy&rsquo;s leadership abilities because he was young (see 1 Timothy 4:12). Paul intended to visit Timothy in person, but he was unsure whether he would be able to do so (see 1 Timothy 3:14; 4:13). Paul wrote his epistle to Timothy to help the young Church leader better understand his duties.</p>'),

It also contains a prophecy of the &ldquo;perilous times&rdquo; that would exist in the days of Paul and Timothy as well as in the last days (see 2 Timothy 3:1&ndash;7). To help Timothy with the challenges he faced, Paul encouraged him to trust in the scriptures and in Church leaders (see 2 Timothy 3:14&ndash;17) and to rely on true doctrine (see 2 Timothy 4:2).</p> <p>Paul&rsquo;s Second Epistle to Timothy was likely written sometime between A.D. 64 and 65 (see Guide to the Scriptures, &ldquo;Pauline Epistles,&rdquo; scriptures.lds.org). Paul wrote the epistle during his second imprisonment in Rome shortly before his martyrdom (see Bible Dictionary, &ldquo;Pauline Epistles&rdquo;).</p> <p>During his imprisonment Paul was in chains (see 2 Timothy 1:16; 2:9), he was likely in a cell or dungeon and exposed to the elements (see 2 Timothy 4:13, 21), and his friends struggled to locate him (see 2 Timothy 1:17). Luke was apparently his only regular visitor (see 2 Timothy 4:11), and Paul expected that his life was coming to an end (see 2 Timothy 4:6&ndash;8).</p> <p>In this letter Paul encouraged Timothy and offered strength to help him carry on after Paul&rsquo;s impending death. Paul was aware that his time was short, and he desired to see Timothy, whom Paul figuratively called &ldquo;my dearly beloved son&rdquo; (2 Timothy 1:2).</p> <p>At the end of his letter, Paul requested that Timothy and Mark visit him and bring him a few items that he had left behind (see 2 Timothy 4:9&ndash;13). Although Paul&rsquo;s letter was addressed specifically to Timothy, its counsel can be applied to those who live in &ldquo;the last days&rdquo; (2 Timothy 3:1) because Paul taught of challenges and solutions that are relevant to our day as well as his.</p> <p>This letter is one of the pastoral epistles, along with 1 Timothy and Titus, and &ldquo;contains the Apostle&rsquo;s last words and shows the wonderful courage and trust with which he faced death&rdquo; (see Bible Dictionary, &ldquo;Pauline Epistles&rdquo;). <span style="color:#e67e22;"><strong>Chronologically, 2 Timothy appears to be Paul&rsquo;s final letter in the New Testament (see 2 Timothy 4:6).</strong></span></p> <p>This letter contains some of Paul&rsquo;s reflections about the blessings and difficulties of serving as &ldquo;a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles&rdquo; (2 Timothy 1:11). Paul declared, &ldquo;I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness&rdquo; (2 Timothy 4:7&ndash;8), indicating that he had a personal assurance that he would inherit eternal life. As one who had ministered for Jesus Christ for over 30 years, Paul was in an excellent position to instruct Timothy on how to serve effectively in strengthening the faith of others (see 2 Timothy 2:15&ndash;17, 22&ndash;26; 4:1&ndash;2, 5).</p>'),

Paul wrote that the <span style="font-size:110%;font-variant:small-caps;">&ldquo;hope of eternal life&rdquo; was first promised by God in the pre-earth life &ldquo;before the world began&rdquo; (Titus 1:2).</span> He taught that the Saints should look forward to &ldquo;that blessed hope&rdquo; of exaltation and to the Second Coming (Titus 2:13). Paul also wrote to Titus about &ldquo;the washing of regeneration&rdquo; and the &ldquo;renewing of the Holy Ghost&rdquo; (Titus 3:5), alluding to the ordinance of baptism and the purifying effect of receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, both of which are preparatory to being &ldquo;made heirs according to the hope of eternal life&rdquo; (Titus 3:7). By studying Paul&rsquo;s inspired counsel to Titus, you can increase your <span style="font-size:110%;font-variant:small-caps;">faith that the doctrines and ordinances of the gospel bring hope for eternal life</span>.</p> <p>It is likely that Paul wrote the Epistle to Titus between his writing of 1 and 2 Timothy, around A.D. 64&ndash;65 (see Guide to the Scriptures, &ldquo;Pauline Epistles,&rdquo; scriptures.lds.org). Paul wrote the Epistle to Titus after his first imprisonment in Rome. <span style="color:#2ecc71;">He did not indicate where he was when he wrote this epistle.</span></p> <p>To Whom Was It Written and Why?</p> <p>This epistle was written by Paul to Titus, whom Paul referred to as &ldquo;mine own son after the common faith&rdquo; (Titus 1:4). Titus was a Greek (see Galatians 2:3) and had been converted to the gospel by Paul himself (see Bible Dictionary, &ldquo;Titus&rdquo;). After his conversion, Titus labored with Paul to spread the gospel and organize the Church (see Bible Dictionary, &ldquo;Titus&rdquo;). He helped gather donations for the poor in Jerusalem (see 2 Corinthians 8:6, 16&ndash;23) and also accompanied Paul to the Jerusalem council (see Galatians 2:1). Paul entrusted Titus to take his first epistle to the Saints living in Corinth (see 2 Corinthians 7:5&ndash;15). He wrote to Titus to strengthen him in his assignment to lead and care <span style="color:#f1c40f;">for the branch of the Church in Crete in spite of opposition</span> (see Titus 1:5, 10&ndash;11; 2:15; 3:10).</p> <p>This letter is one of the pastoral epistles (to a pastor, or leader, in the Church), along with 1 and 2 Timothy (see Bible Dictionary, &ldquo;Pauline Epistles&rdquo;). The Epistle of Titus provides the earliest evidence that the Church had been established on the Greek island of Crete in the Mediterranean Sea (see Titus 1:5). Titus had the responsibility of calling new bishops on the island. Paul listed <span style="color:#7f8c8d;">some</span> of the spiritual qualifications for bishops (see Titus 1:6&ndash;9). In addition, he gave specific advice to men, women, and servants on <span style="color:#4e5f70;">proper behavior for Saints</span> (see Titus 2:2&ndash;10).</p>'),

The story suggests a beautiful type/ parallel with Christ being exalted by his God and Father to being His righthand man in His Kingdom. Pharaoh announces to Joseph: &ldquo;You shall be over my house, and according to your command all my people shall do homage; only in the throne I will be greater then you.&rdquo; And Pharaoh said to Joseph, &ldquo;See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.&rdquo; Then Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph&rsquo;s hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen, and put the gold necklace around his neck. And he had him ride in his second chariot; and they proclaimed before him, &ldquo;Bow the knee!&rdquo; And he set him over all the land of Egypt. Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, &ldquo;Though I am Pharaoh, yet without your permission no one shall raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt&rdquo; (Ex. 41:40-44). What a beautiful picture of the kind of prominence and place of honour God has exalted the Lord Jesus to. This was not a position Christ had by always being God from eternity. Jesus is &ldquo;the first-born from the dead; so that he himself might come to have first place in everything.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p> <p>&mdash; They Never Told Me This in Church! by Greg Deuble</p> <p>&ldquo;For &ldquo;God has put all things in subjection under his feet.&rdquo; But when it says, &ldquo;all things are put in subjection,&rdquo; it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him (1Cor. 15:27). This means that God&rsquo;s purpose in Christ is to make man His vice-regent over all of creation, second only to God in the universe! All this is what God will accomplish in and through Christ&mdash;as man, for the words in Psalm 8 concern man and Yahweh&rsquo;s exalted purpose for him. This finds a good illustration in the well-known story of Joseph, whom Pharaoh appointed ruler over everything in Egypt&mdash;everything, that is, excluding Pharaoh himself (Gen. 45:26), thus making him second only to Pharaoh in the whole land. Such is God&rsquo;s glorious predestined plan for man in Christ. The exaltation of Christ in Philippians 2:9-11 can be illustrated by the exaltation of Joseph as ruler of Egypt in the following manner, &ldquo;Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph&rsquo;s hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck&rdquo; (Genesis 41:42). These were not merely ceremonial acts, for by them Pharaoh conferred his own authority and glory upon Joseph, most notably by giving Joseph his signet ring which bore his personal seal, with which the king&rsquo;s official orders were sealed. That meant that Pharaoh entrusted the full weight of his personal authority to Joseph, thereby empowering him to act on Pharaoh&rsquo;s behalf. In the same way, in Philippians 2:9-11, Yahweh conferred on Jesus His own divine glory and authority. Just as the signet ring bore Pharaoh&rsquo;s name (the name above all names in Egypt) upon it, so, too, Yahweh conferred on Jesus the name above all names, and thereby fully empowered Jesus to act on His behalf. Yet the fact that the man Christ Jesus will be second only to Yahweh God in all of creation (and we in Christ) seems not good enough for trinitarians. Out of a misguided &ldquo;zeal for God, but not according to knowledge&rdquo; (Rom. 10:2; in which I also shared), they insist that Christ has to be absolutely equal with God in every way&mdash;something which Christ himself refused to grasp at (Phil. 2:6). For some strange (perhaps perverse?) reason they will not have it that Yahweh alone must be &ldquo;all in all&rdquo; (1Cor. 15:28), even though this is what the Son himself affirms by his own subjection to God, who subjected all things to him (v. 28). We do well to be careful lest we allow our misguided &ldquo;zeal&rdquo; to bring us into condemnation.&rdquo;</p> <p>&mdash; The Only True God: A Study of Biblical Monotheism by Eric H.H. Chang, Bentley C.F. Chan</p> <p>I looked through a bunch of Trinitarian commentaries on this Joseph story and none of them seem to get the type here.

Today, it is not politically correct to stand up for God in our schools and public venues, and Christians are outraged at this secular injustice.

They provide a vista view of the outcome of human history. The future of humanity is bound up with the future of the royal house of David. From that family there will emerge a statesman-Messiah competent to solve the world&rsquo;s intractable problems. The covenant granted to David is nothing less than a divine charter authorizing the Messiah and His associates to rule the world. History is marching to that inevitable goal. Ignored by historians, philosophers and anthropologists and neglected by theologians, this precious information illuminates the later story of Jesus and the early Christians. It helps to account for the passionate zeal with which they spread the Good News. They saw themselves as participants in the greatest venture ever conceived by man&mdash;or rather conceived by God. Convinced of the claims of Jesus, Christians aligned themselves with the Messiah and His Message. Knowing that Jesus was divinely appointed to govern the world and that He was inviting them to share that authority with Him, they saw themselves as a kind of fifth column in a hostile world system. Their true status was unrecognized, as they worked in the service of an absent king, anticipating the overthrow of present governments at the reappearance of the Messiah.</p> <p>Because so few accepted Jesus and His Messianic agenda (&ldquo;narrow is the way leading to life [in the Kingdom] and few find it,&rdquo; Matt. 7:14), those who did are said in the New Testament to be in possession of a precious divine secret, an invaluable treasure, for which no sacrifice is too great (Matt. 13:44-46). The secret was their understanding of God&rsquo;s Kingdom Plan, and their goal was to qualify for life in the coming age of the Kingdom and an appointment as co-regent with the Messiah. And even if the hostile world were to put them to death, they would reappear immortalized in the resurrection. The gates of Hades even would not prevail against them.</p> <p>&ldquo;Most appropriately the term &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; or &ldquo;Anointed King&rdquo; became the title for the expected king of the line of David who would preside over the temple and the Kingdom of God. It is the essence of Christian belief that the historical Jesus, born in Bethlehem, is the person about whom the inspired documents had spoken. It is important not to miss the Bible&rsquo;s own definition of the Kingdom. It means the reign on a permanently secure throne of the ultimate ruler, representing God in the Davidic Kingdom as the sovereign of the Kingdom of God on earth. The Messiah or Son of God is to be ruler in &ldquo;My,&rdquo; i.e. God&rsquo;s, Kingdom (I Chron. 17: 14). We must emphasize that the divine Plan has to do with &ldquo;a place for Israel&rdquo; (II Sam. 7: 10), a throne and a Kingdom. None of these terms must be allowed to slip away from our grasp. These are words with normal, natural meanings. They have to do with an empire on earth and a king ruling in Jerusalem. They are exactly the terms taken up by Gabriel in Luke 1:32-33 which picks up the threads of the divine drama by pointing back to the Davidic covenant and forward to the arrival of the Davidic empire&mdash;a new world order which will supersede our present world system forever.&rdquo;</p> <p>&mdash; Our Fathers Who Aren&#39;t in Heaven by Anthony Buzzard<br /> &nbsp;</p>'),

The word is adoni and in all of its 195 occurrences in the Old Testament it means a superior who is human (or occasionally angelic), created and not God. So Psalm 110:1 presents the clearest evidence that the Messiah is not God, but a supremely exalted man. This verse holds the record by far as the most popular verse quoted in the New Testament from the Old. Jesus and the rabbis acclaimed it as an infallible divine oracle (see Matt. 22:42-45).<br /> The uniqueness of the Father of Jesus is beautifully sustained by the careful distinction between God and exalted man depicted by Psalm 110:1. Yahweh, the One God, is distinguished from &ldquo;my lord.&rdquo; The Hebrew word should not be capitalized in English here. In the remaining 194 passages it has no capital. The Revised Version of the Bible corrected the error of capitalization because with a capital L the reader suspects that the Hebrew word is adonai, the title of God. But the word is not adonai. It refers to a person who is expressly not God, but distinguished from the One God. The Hebrew Bible is very careful not to muddle God and man. The whole point of the Messiah whom it predicts is that he belongs to the category of mankind, not God and certainly not an angel.</p>'),

And while Is.8:13-15 says that &ldquo;Jehovah of armies Himself&hellip; shall be&hellip; for a stone of stumbling&rdquo;, Scripture also states that He will lay a rock upon which unbelievers would stumble - from which we may properly conclude that:</p> <p>Jesus, as the rock God laid, TYPIFIES the Rock which is God, but is not himself God.</p> <p>Isaiah Distinguishes Between God And The Messiah</p> <p>Isaiah makes a continuous distinction between God and His Messiah-to-come, establishing that this Messiah is not God but His anointed representative and savior:</p> <p>&ldquo;Behold my servant, whom I uphold&hellip; I have put my spirit upon him&rdquo; - Is.42:1</p> <p>&ldquo;I, Jehovah&hellip; will&hellip; give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; To open the blind eyes&hellip;&rdquo; - Is.42:6,7</p> <p>&ldquo;Jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all&hellip; it pleased Jehovah to bruise him; He hath put him to grief&rdquo; - Is.53:6,10</p> <p>&ldquo;Jehovah hath anointed me&hellip; he hath sent me&rdquo; - Is.61:1</p> <p>In light of Isaiah&rsquo;s continuous and clear distinction between God and Jesus, it would make no sense to interpret Isaiah 6:1,5 etc. as equating Jesus WITH God, nor does it, nor does John say that it does.</p>'),

Luke firmly and plainly places the coming into existence of the Son of God at the time of his conception in Mary&rsquo;s womb, as we shall see in the next section. What Luke describes is not a transformation of an existing person into subsequent human existence. Luke knows nothing of a Jesus who had previously existed as a spirit.

Mary, who was just some insignificant young girl to those around her, probably playing with dolls, and in another case fishermen, who were basically the blue-collar workers of their day, the type that would be riding around in the back of a pickup truck today, and in this case, shepherds who were actually living outside with their sheep. I&#39;m sure that the last thing on their minds when they clocked in for work that night was that an Angel of God was going to appear to them.</p> <p>I&#39;ve noticed that God often does things suddenly and unexpectedly.</p> <p>And there were shepherds in the same area, living out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock at night. And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were frightened with great fear. And the angel said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, for listen, I bring you good news that will cause great joy, which will be for all the people.</p> <p>For to you was born this day in the city of David the Savior, who is the Messiah and Lord.</p> <p>Luke 2:8-11 (Revised English Version)</p> <p>As far as the nobodies of the world go, I can&rsquo;t help but think about what the Apostle Paul once wrote to the church in Corinth:</p> <p>Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things&mdash;and the things that are not&mdash;to nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before him. It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God&mdash;that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. Therefore, as it is written: &ldquo;Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.&rdquo;</p> <p>1 Corinthians 1:26-31 (New International Version)</p> <p>So there it is, God deliberately chooses the nobodies of the world so that they will not boast about themselves, but instead they will boast about the God who has chosen them for such awesome revelations!</p>'),

But whoever shall deny me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven&rdquo; (Matt. 10:32). &ldquo;Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, of him will the Son of Man [Jesus] be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of [God] the Father and of the holy angels&rdquo; (Luke 9:26).

Ask a typical churchgoer and he will quote the words of Jesus to the thief: &ldquo;Today you will be with me in Paradise&rdquo; (Luke 23:43). This is supposed to settle the question with finality.</p> <p>But the problem is this: Luke 23:43 is a fraction of the total biblical evidence available for study. Nevertheless many will settle for an easy &ldquo;solution.&rdquo; That verse obviously proves, they think, that Jesus and the thief departed at the moment of death into the presence of the Father in heaven. On that basis, churchgoers are exhorted to believe that they too will survive death as &ldquo;souls&rdquo; and pass on to celestial regions.</p> <p>Imagine a conversation between a child and her mother: &ldquo;Mommy, where did Jesus go the day he died?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, to heaven to be with God, dear. Do you remember he said that he and the thief would be together that day in Paradise?&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;But wait, Mommy, do you remember that Jesus earlier said that he would &lsquo;be three days in the heart of the earth&rsquo;? If he was in the heart of the earth, how can he have been with the Father in heaven?&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Well, dear, perhaps Jesus&rsquo; spirit was with the Father while his body was in the heart of the earth.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;But how can that be, Mommy? Three days after the day Jesus died he said to his friends: &lsquo;I (Jesus) have not yet ascended to the Father.&rsquo; How could he possibly have gone to heaven to the Father, if three days later he said he had not yet ascended to the Father?&rdquo;</p> <p>Mommy&rsquo;s attempt to answer the difficulty includes an immense and unproven assumption: that in the Bible a person can go on existing consciously as a &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; or &ldquo;soul&rdquo; separated from their body. For Mommy&rsquo;s &ldquo;solution&rdquo; to be true that assumption must be biblically demonstrated. But the &ldquo;departed soul&rdquo; concept owes its origin to Platonic philosophy and not to the Bible at all. The Interpreter&rsquo;s Bible Dictionary says correctly: &ldquo;No biblical text authorizes the idea that the soul separates from the body at death&rdquo; (Vol. 1, p. 802).</p> <p>So what is the solution to our question about what happens when we die? First we must lay out the facts:</p> <p>1) Jesus apparently said that he would be on the day</p> <p>of his death with the thief in the presence of the</p> <p>Father (Luke 23:43).</p> <p>2) Jesus said with complete clarity that he would be</p> <p>in the heart of the earth when he died and remain</p> <p>there for three days (Matt. 12:40).</p> <p>3) Peter confirms this by saying that God did not</p> <p>leave Jesus in the world of the dead, Hades1 (Acts 2:31). This proves that Jesus did indeed go to the world of the dead. But God did not leave him there. He brought him out of the tomb by resurrection three days after he died.</p> <p>4) When the women arrived at the tomb, the angel said, &ldquo;He is not here. He has risen from the dead&rdquo; (Matt. 28:6). This proves that Jesus had indeed been in the tomb until he was resurrected.</p> <p>5) On the Sunday after his death, Jesus expressly said: &ldquo;I have not yet ascended to my Father&rdquo; (John 20:17). So he could not possibly have been to heaven before the resurrection Sunday.</p> <p>Here is what the evidence presents:</p> <p>Points 2-5 demonstrate that Jesus went to the</p> <p>grave at his death and that he did not go to the Father in heaven the day he died.</p> <p>Point 1 alone (the very point which most rely on almost instinctively) appears to contradict the evidence of points 2-5.</p> <p>How shall we resolve the problem?</p> <p>The Bible does not contradict itself. If Jesus was in the heart of the earth he cannot have been with the Father in Paradise (the text does not say, as many assume, &ldquo;heaven&rdquo;).</p> <p>Here is the solution which resolves the apparent contradiction.</p> <p>What Jesus actually said to the thief on the Friday of their crucifixion was: &ldquo;Truly I tell you today, you will be with me in Paradise.&rdquo; Punctuating the sentence that way &mdash; putting the comma after</p> <p>1 Wrongly translated in the KJV as &ldquo;hell.&rdquo; Modern translations have happily corrected the error.</p> <p>&ldquo;today&rdquo; &mdash; makes sense of the immediate context and brings the statement into line with Jesus&rsquo; other clear statements that he did not go anywhere other than to the grave that day &mdash; the day of his and the thief&rsquo;s death.</p> <p>Now we are ready to follow the whole of Jesus&rsquo; conversation with the thief:</p> <p>The thief, in a repentant frame of mind, begs Jesus: &ldquo;Lord, remember me when you come [in the future] bringing in your Kingdom.&rdquo; His request was to be remembered on the future day of the arrival of Jesus to set up the Kingdom of God, the Christian hope. The thief demonstrated faith in the Gospel: firstly, that the Kingdom of God is coming and secondly that Jesus was the Messiah.</p> <p>Jesus graciously gave the thief more than he asked. He said: &ldquo;Truly I assure you today [you don&rsquo;t have to wait to be remembered in the future], you will indeed be with me in the future Paradise [of the Kingdom of God on earth].&rdquo; Paradise is the restored garden of Eden in the renewed earth of the Kingdom which Jesus will bring at his second coming (Rev. 2:7). Jesus equated Paradise, which he promised the thief, with the Kingdom of God in which the thief requested a place.</p> <p>Jesus did not go to heaven at death. No one in the Bible goes to heaven at death. Everyone goes to the grave, the world of the dead (Hades), to await the resurrection which will occur when Jesus comes back to establish his Kingdom. As I Corinthians 15:23 says so beautifully: &ldquo;Those who belong to Christ will be resurrected at his coming.&rdquo; Until then they remain in the grave (Hades), the residence of all the dead, including Jesus when he died, until they are called out of Hades as Jesus was three days after his death. Only Jesus has so far emerged from Hades into immortality. He did this on the third day, the day of his resurrection.</p> <p>Now back to the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; of Luke 23:43, so often quoted as a supposed proof of an immediate presence of the soul in heaven, in contradiction to the plain statements that Jesus did not go to the Father the day he died.</p> <p>In many New Testament Greek manuscripts the words are written without gaps and without punctuation. So Luke 23:43 would look like this: TRULYISAYTOYOUTODAYYOUWILLBEWITH MEINPARADISE.</p> <p>Where shall we put the comma?</p> <p>1) After &ldquo;today&rdquo; and read: &ldquo;Truly I say to you today, you will be with me in Paradise.&rdquo;</p> <p>2) After &ldquo;to you&rdquo; and read: &ldquo;Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&rdquo;</p> <p>In some very early manuscripts of the Bible there</p> <p>is some indication of punctuation, as we shall explain.</p> <p>We must investigate all the evidence before making up our minds on a biblical teaching. The Truth sets us free (John 8:32). Christians are those who believe what is true.</p> <p>There are examples of the phrase &ldquo;I say to you today...&rdquo; elsewhere in the Bible. The phrase is used to convey solemn emphasis. In Deuteronomy 30:16, 18, 19 we read:</p> <p>&ldquo;I command you this day....&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;I declare to you this day....&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;I call heaven and earth to witness to you this</p> <p>day....&rdquo;</p> <p>And in the New Testament Acts 20:26 provides a</p> <p>parallel: &ldquo;I solemnly witness to you this very day....&rdquo; Further examples will be found in Deut. 4:26, 39, 40; 6:6; 7:11; 8:1, 11, 19; 9:3; 10:13; 11:2, 8, 13, 26, 27, 28, 32; 13:18; 15:5; 19:9; 26:3, 16, 18; 27:1, 4, 10; 28:1, 13, 14, 15; 29:12; 30:2, 8, 11, 15, 16, 18, 19; 32:46. Observe also Gen. 25:33: &ldquo;Swear to me today...&rdquo; Gen. 22:14: &ldquo;that they might say today...&rdquo; Gen. 41:9: &ldquo;I today remember...&rdquo; Deut. 9:6: &ldquo;Today you will know...&rdquo; Deut. 29:10: &ldquo;Today you all stand...&rdquo; Deut. 30:6: &ldquo;I announce to you today....&rdquo;</p> <p>Detailed punctuation in the Bible has been added by translators and it can drastically affect the meaning of the text. Hebrews 10:12 is an example of erroneous punctuation in the King James Version; i.e., the comma should follow &ldquo;sins&rdquo; not &ldquo;ever.&rdquo; It is only reasonable to repunctuate Luke 23:43 in a way which makes it harmonize with everything else the Bible says about death and Resurrection. Daniel 12:2 and John 5:28, 29 remain as solemn testimonies to the fact that the dead are not in heaven, but that they rise from the ground or their tombs on the future great Resurrection day:</p> <p>&ldquo;Many of those who are sleeping in the dust of the ground shall arise...to everlasting life...&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;The hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice, those who have done good to a resurrection of life...&rdquo;</p> <p>Nothing should be allowed to disturb the central biblical doctrine of the future Resurrection of all the faithful from the sleep of death to life in the</p> <p>Kingdom of God. This stupendous event will occur when Jesus returns (1 Cor. 15:23).</p> <p>Many of the Greek manuscripts of the Bible do not have punctuation. However, some very early manuscripts do have some marks of punctuation. In the Vatican Codex (4th century) there is evidence of a comma after the word &ldquo;today.&rdquo; And in the Curetonian version of the Syriac translation of Luke (5th century), we read &ldquo;Amen, I say to you today, that with me you will be in the Garden of Eden.&rdquo;</p> <p>A German translation of the Bible, published in 1934 by Wilhelm Michaelis (Kroner Verlag, Leipzig) renders Luke 23:43 as follows: &ldquo;Truly I give you my assurance today: You will one day be with me in Paradise.&rdquo; The author adds this comment in a footnote: &ldquo;Jesus does not wait until the last day, but promises the thief even now (&lsquo;today&rsquo; should probably be attached to the first part of the sentence) that his request will be granted. Paradise occurs in the NT only in 2 Cor. 12:4 and Rev. 2:7 and is the equivalent of everlasting life or Kingdom of God&rdquo; (translation from the German mine). The Rotherham Bible (1895, reprinted in 1974) reads as follows: &ldquo;Verily I say unto thee this day: With me shalt thou be in Paradise.&rdquo; The official translation of the Roman Catholics, the Latin Vulgate, does not place a comma anywhere in this verse. It thus avoids the false impression that Jesus was in heaven on the day of his death.</p> <p>The celebrated Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Vol. 5, p. 385, says: &ldquo;Paradise, as used in Luke 23:43..., is evidently not heaven (John 20:17, Acts 2:31).&rdquo; In other words John 20:17 and Acts 2:31 show that Jesus could not have gone to the Father in heaven on the day of his death. And similarly, no Christian goes immediately to heaven at death.</p> <p>This fact has not prevented popular preaching of Luke 23:43 as a guarantee of &ldquo;heaven at death&rdquo; for the believer.</p> <p>As with all &ldquo;restorationist&rdquo; movements our purpose is to alert our fellow Bible readers to the paganism which has crept into the faith. We cannot think that serious Christians will be satisfied with the status quo once they are informed of doctrines which masquerade as truth, however popular. Popular phrases such as &ldquo;so and so has passed on, gone home, gone to be with Jesus in heaven&rdquo; do not reflect the teaching of Jesus at all. They have more in common with spiritism and illicit raising of the dead and are condemned in Scripture as worthless and dangerous.</p> <p>We ask only for a fair examination of the facts and there is a vast quantity of additional evidence available.</p> <p>Focus on the Kingdom<br /> Volume 2 No. 3 Anthony Buzzard, editor December, 1999</p>'),

So there is no good reason for the word logos to refer to a preexisting Son of God. In fact, nowhere in the entire Bible can you find any Hebrew or Greek word for &ldquo;word&rdquo; that implies another preexisting person in the Godhead. Also in John 1:2, 3, the words &ldquo;He&rdquo; and &ldquo;Him&rdquo; are impersonal pronouns in the Greek and therefore should be translated as &ldquo;it&rdquo; when referring to logos. Every English Bible before the King James Version of 1611 translated the pronouns this way. The following is an example. In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God: and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by it, and without it nothing was made that was made.

Note Schonfield, Authentic New Testament: &ldquo;In the beginning was the expressed concept.&rdquo; If we read &ldquo;In the beginning was the SON&rdquo; we make two who are GOD, and this breaks the fundamental and easy, express monotheism of Jesus (Mk. 12:29; 1 Cor. 8:4-6) and the whole of the Bible. Sadly John 1: 1 has been used to contradict Jesus in John 17:3 and the detailed birth narratives of Matthew and Luke, and the more than 1300 NT references to GOD as the Father. There are thousands of references to God in Scripture as a single Person, defined by singular personal pronouns. The God of the Bible is a single divine &ldquo;someone,&rdquo; &ldquo;self.&rdquo; The moment someone else, the Son, is said to be God, two Gods are posited; the universe is &ldquo;tinkered with&rdquo; and idolatry is introduced (cp. 1John 5:20-21 for fair warning).&rdquo;</p> <p>&mdash; The One God, the Father, One Man Messiah Translation: New Testament with Commentary by Anthony Buzzard</p>'),

It is well known among Biblical scholars that some of the wording of the NT was altered - and sometimes wholly counterfeited - by copyists with a trinitarian agenda. Nor is it likely that all such alterations have been identified. The earliest known copies of the Book of John date to the second century - plenty of time for tampering to have taken place. Again, these alleged words of Jesus stand at odds with the overwhelming weight of Scripture which says that it was his God and Father who raised him. But even if these words were uttered by Jesus, it is entirely conceivable that as God&rsquo;s prophet (Mk.6:4) it was God speaking through Jesus (John 14:10, 24, etc.). This is consistent with the rest of Scripture - which says that God would, and did, raise him.</p> <p>SUMMARY</p> <p>Thirty one New Testament verses agree that Jesus said he would BE raised, and that he WAS raised (the Greek &ldquo;passive voice&rdquo; form of the verb indicating that he was raised by someone other than himself), in contradistinction to two (questionable) reports that Jesus said he would raise himself, or that he himself would rebuild the temple of his body.</p> <p>Many of those thirty one verses explicitly state that it was &ldquo;God&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the Father&rdquo; who raised Jesus.</p> <p>Despite trinitarian arguments, Peter did not say that the Holy Spirit resurrected Jesus but that Jesus&rsquo;s own spirit was made alive when his body died (and prior to his resurrection).</p> <p>No after-the-fact report of Jesus&rsquo;s resurrection attributes it to any member of the Trinity other than the Father.</p> <p>CONCLUSION</p> <p>Neither Jesus nor the Holy Spirit had a role in his resurrection. It was the Father alone who raised him from the dead.</p> <p>Steven Blake</p>'),

While believers receive everlasting life, the wicked will perish. But if the wicked receive everlasting torment in hell, then they will not perish. To be tormented forever, the wicked need to be given everlasting life as well. If that is the case, the difference between the wicked and believers are not in their final state of being, but only in the nature of that life. Believers will get an everlasting life with the Lord, while the wicked will receive an everlasting life in torment. However, John 3:16 speaks about the different state of being between the wicked and believers: One will perish, and the other will receive everlasting life.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Death is the opposite of life. The same dichotomy from John 3:16 can also be seen in Romans 6:23 (&ldquo; For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord&rdquo;). In this verse, the contradiction is clear: God&rsquo;s gift is eternal life, while sin leads to death. Death is the opposite of life. Death does not mean eternal suffering because to suffer eternally would require life. Death means death.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;The one thing death does not mean is &lsquo;not dying&rsquo;&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;For conditionalists, three main biblical arguments contradict the above Platonic view: 1 Timothy 1:17, 6:16, and 2Timothy 1:10. Quoting these verses, Stott argues that only God possesses immortality in Himself and God reveals and gives immortality to humanity through the gospel. In other words, God only extends immortality as a gift for those who believe in Jesus Christ for salvation. The wicked will not be given eternal life&ndash;either in hell or elsewhere.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;For those who believe in Christ, the gift is everlasting life. This everlasting life is not given to all humanity but only gifted to those who believe.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;The first letter of John states this gift of life clearly by saying &ldquo;whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.&rdquo; (1 John 5: 12). From this verse it is clear that life is conditional. Not everyone will have life. Only those who believe in Christ will have this eternal life that God inherently possesses.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Conditionalism argues that eternal life is conditional. Eternal life is a gift only given to those who trust in Jesus. Therefore, conditionalists view God&rsquo;s gift of eternal life as more valuable than traditionalists&rsquo; view.&rdquo;</p> <p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">&mdash; Conditional Immortality: The Case for Orthodoxy on the Doctrine of Annihilationism by Tanwin Tanoto</span></p>'),

Anyone who can believe this twisted and contradictory doctrine will not find it hard to believe any error that comes along his way. It must have taken an impressive power of persuasion to pull off this deception, not just on a few individuals but on great multitudes throughout church history. This causes one to wonder if the persuasiveness of the deception comes from some supernatural force. We are reminded of the words in Revelation: &ldquo;that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world&rdquo; (Rev. 12:9). What it means is that no one, no matter how intelligent or educated, can escape from the paralyzing grip of spiritual deception. Spiritual perception, on the other hand, involves &ldquo;having the eyes of your hearts enlightened&rdquo; by God (Eph. 1:18), enabling the heart to see the liberating light of His truth.

See the following: &ldquo;Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus; that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Rom. 15:5-6). &ldquo;For this reason, I bow my knees before the Father&rdquo; (Eph. 3:14). &ldquo;Always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father&rdquo; (Eph. 5:20). &ldquo;Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever.

This list is by no means exhaustive. But it is sufficient to show that we are, with our Lord Jesus, to worship and pray to the Father.

Where there is belief in more than one person who is God, that is polytheism by definition. What we need to realize is that trinitarianism is in essence, therefore, a different faith from Biblical monotheism. So we are not here dealing with the relatively simpler matter of Biblical interpretation, but with the far more profound matter of Biblical faith.

No one has ever seen God, but the only Son who is at the Father&rsquo;s side, has made him known. Not only did Jesus bring us the good news of the coming Kingdom of God, but he brought us a deeper understanding of God the Father. His message of mercy, forgiveness, love, compassion, hope and grace was so that we might know God better and live our lives in a manner pleasing to Him.

In fact the word &ldquo;monotheism&rdquo; is found in the Bible in Jesus&rsquo; own words, where in his prayer to God, the Father, he says, &ldquo;this is eternal life: that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent&rdquo; (John 17:3). &ldquo;Monotheism&rdquo; is made up of two Greek words: monos (&ldquo; only, alone,&rdquo; and as the BDAG Greek-English lexicon explains: &ldquo;with focus on being the only one&rdquo;) and theos (&ldquo; God&rdquo;). It is precisely these two words which are found in Jesus&rsquo; words which he addresses to the Father as &ldquo;the only (monos) true God (theos)&rdquo;. It is important also to notice carefully that Jesus&rsquo; words in John 17:3 have to do with eternal life, and that this involves two essential components: (1) &ldquo;that they know you the only true God&rdquo; and (2) &ldquo;Jesus Christ whom you have sent&rdquo;. Having eternal life is not merely a matter of &ldquo;believing in Jesus&rdquo; as some preachers would have people think. Jesus himself tells us that one must first come to know the one true God, and then also to know Jesus as the one sent by that one God.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Jesus&rsquo; words are so clear that no complicated linguistic techniques are needed to explain them. What Jesus states with crystal clarity is that there is only one God, the One he calls &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; and he asks his disciples to call upon Him in the same way (&ldquo; Our Father in heaven&rdquo;). Jesus speaks of himself as the one sent by &ldquo;the only true God&rdquo;. It should, therefore, have been perfectly obvious to anyone truly listening to what Jesus said that if the Father is the one and only true God, then no one else can also be God alongside Him. It should be absolutely clear from Jesus&rsquo; words that he definitely excludes himself from any claim to deity by this absolute monos or &ldquo;only&rdquo; referring to the Father. Only the fact that we have been immersed in trinitarianism all our lives prevents us from hearing what Jesus says in these words. Christians have come to that spiritual state in which we address Jesus as &ldquo;Lord, Lord&rdquo; but do not hear or do what he says (Lk. 6:46; cf. Mt. 7:21,22). We have become accustomed to imposing our own doctrines upon his teaching, and when these doctrines are incompatible with his words, we simply ignore what he actually said. But whether we like it or not, monotheism is at the very root of Jesus&rsquo; life and teaching.&rdquo;</p> <p>&mdash; The Only True God: A Study of Biblical Monotheism by Eric H.H.

That Christ cannot be here denying the Deity of Himself and of the Spirit we well know from many other passages, but what did He mean by affirming that the Father is &quot;the only true God&quot;? We believe the answer is twofold:&mdash;First, Christ was here excluding the idols of the Gentiles&mdash;false gods, el., 1 Thessalonians 1:9:&mdash;to denote that that Godhead is only true that is in the Father. The Son and the Spirit are not excluded because they are of the same essence with the Father. The Son and the Spirit are &quot;true God,&quot; not without, but in the Father. &quot;I and the Father are one&quot; (John 10:30); &quot;the Father is in me, and I in him&quot; (John 10:38): not divided in essence, but distinguished in personality. In 1 John 5:20 the Son Himself is called &quot;the only true God!&quot; Which no more excludes the Father than John 17:3 excludes the Son. Many such exclusive statements are to be found in Scripture, that must be expounded by the analogy of faith. For example: &quot;No one knoweth the Father, but the Son, and none knoweth the Son, but the Father&quot; (Matthew 11:27); but this excludes not the Spirit, for He &quot;searcheth the depths of God&quot; (1Cor. 2:10).

And after a mighty oration the Greeks of Caesarea hailed King Agrippa I with the words, &ldquo;The voice of a god and not of a man!&rdquo; (Acts 12:22).

The locals expected Paul to swell up and die but when he showed no ill effects the same people changed their minds and began to say that Paul was &ldquo;a god&rdquo; (Acts 28:6). The translators know that the natives did not think that Paul was &ldquo;God&rdquo; so they wrote Paul was &ldquo;a god.&rdquo; Another instance: In Acts 12 King Herod gave a moving oration and the people cried out, &ldquo;The voice of a god, not of a man!&rdquo; (v. 22).

But Barnabas and Paul cried out, &ldquo;Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men of the same nature with you&rdquo; (v. 15). Jesus, as we see him in the New Testament, is a man with the same nature as all human beings, just as Elijah was a man with the &ldquo;same nature&rdquo; as us (James 5: 17).

Saying, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; became a way of declaring Jesus&rsquo; deity. It began with Thomas&rsquo; exclamation when Jesus appeared to the disciples after His resurrection: &ldquo;Thomas said to him, &lsquo;My Lord and my God!&rsquo;&rdquo; (John 20:28). From then on, the apostles&rsquo; message was that Jesus is Lord, meaning &ldquo;Jesus is God.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s sermon on the Day of Pentecost contained that theme: &ldquo;Let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah&rdquo; (Acts 2:36). Later, in Cornelius&rsquo;s house, Peter declared that Jesus is &ldquo;Lord of all&rdquo; (Acts 10:36).

Speaking on Romans 10: 9, &ldquo;that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved,&rdquo; Martyn Lloyd-Jones asserts that the text teaches two essentials. The first is that Jesus is Lord, and the second is that God raised him from the dead. Those are the two absolute essentials of the Christian faith. There is no salvation unless we are clear about them. But right here Lloyd-Jones makes a fundamental and classic mistake. He claims: the word translated &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; is used in the Greek translation of the Old Testament to stand for the Hebrew word &ldquo;YHWH&rdquo; (Jehovah)&mdash;the name by which God wished to be personally known... so this statement, &ldquo;that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord,&rdquo; means, &ldquo;If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Jehovah (YHWH)!&rdquo; Jesus is the Lord God Jehovah!... You say, &ldquo;My faith rests upon Jesus, Jesus of Nazareth, but I say that He is God, He is Jehovah.&rdquo; This is the Christian confession.[ 179] It is a sad thing for me to read such erudite scholars making such baseless, misleading claims. If they are to be consistent, what do they make of the confessions of the early New Testament Christians who called Jesus &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; but had no idea they were calling him Jehovah? An example or two will suffice. When Mary Magdalene found Jesus&rsquo; grave empty, she wept with deep emotion, because she thought somebody had stolen the body. She did not recognize that the risen Jesus was standing right in front of her. Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?&rdquo; Mary supposed Jesus was the gardener and said to him, &ldquo;Sir [Greek kurios, &ldquo;Lord&rdquo;], if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away&rdquo; (John 20: 15). Here Mary, thinking Jesus is no higher a dignitary than the gardener, calls him &ldquo;Lord.&rdquo; No one in their right mind would believe for a moment that Mary thought the gardener was Jehovah, the Lord God! The translators rightly render the word Lord here as &ldquo;Sir.&rdquo; The same appellation is given by the Philippian jailer to Paul and Silas, the prisoners under his charge. The jailer falls at their feet and calls them Lords, that is, sirs. In John 4 the woman at the well has just met Jesus. Jesus has not yet even told her he is the Messiah. But she addresses him as Lord: &ldquo;Sir [kurios, &ldquo;Lord&rdquo;], you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep&rdquo; (v. 11). Martyn Lloyd-Jones is evidently unaware that the one Greek word for Lord may be applied to either God or man.&rdquo;</p> <p>&mdash; They Never Told Me This in Church! by Greg Deuble</p>'),

He had the choice of whether or not to obey God, and hence he was temptable. Scripture makes it clear that God cannot be tempted (James 1:13).

The power of that Kingdom Gospel &mdash; the dynamic, vitalizing activity of God in us &mdash; comes from God and it is invested in frail human persons (II Cor. 4:7).<br /> Paul develops his theme (5:1ff): &ldquo;We know that if our present earthly house is dissolved [by death] we have a [new] building of God, a house not made with human hands, fit for the coming age&rdquo; (poorly rendered as &ldquo;eternal&rdquo; in many versions). That new body is now &ldquo;reserved in heaven&rdquo; (cp. I Pet. 1:4). Paul continues by referring to our present sufferings, while we wait to receive the bodies which will confer on us immortality. While we are at home in our present bodies, we are absent from the Lord Jesus. While we wait for the coming of Jesus we must continue to walk by faith, not by sight. Our desire and hope is to be absent from our frail bodies in order to be present with the Lord in our new bodies, &ldquo;for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.&rdquo; The obvious contrast is between our present existence as mortals and the future resurrection to occur at Jesus&rsquo; return.<br /> Paul has nothing to say about the interval between death and resurrection.

I call this, &ldquo;The Big Detour.&rdquo; 1. Acts 20: Paul told &ldquo;the elders of the church&rdquo; of Ephesus (vs. 17) that soon many false Christian leaders would rise up from among themselves to &ldquo;draw away the disciples&rdquo; after them (vs. 30). He was so burdened about this coming apostasy that he warned the church &ldquo;night and day with tears&rdquo; (vs. 31). 2. 1 Timothy 4: The Holy Spirit clearly warned that &ldquo;some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons&rdquo; (vs. 1). Here again is a predicted departure from the faith inside the church. 3. 2 Timothy 4: Paul predicted a time would come when many in the church would no longer &ldquo;endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables&rdquo; (verses 3-4). Friend, there is no doubt about it. These words point toward an apostasy in the church that will lead professed Christians to turn from Bible truth to fictitious fables. 4. 2 Peter 2: Peter told the early believers that soon &ldquo;there will be false teachers among you&rdquo; (vs. 1). &ldquo;Among you&rdquo; means inside the church. 5. Jude: After urging believers to contend earnestly for the original faith, Jude warned that &ldquo;certain men&rdquo; had already &ldquo;crept in unnoticed&rdquo; among them (vs. 4). 6. Revelation 2: Jesus Christ Himself sadly told His followers in the church of Ephesus, &ldquo;Nevertheless, I have this against you, that you have left your first love. Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent and do the first works&hellip;&rdquo; (verses 4 and 5). These words are so clear! Many Christians in the early church of Ephesus were Falling Away From the Truth falling away from their initial love for Jesus Christ, who died for them. Thus we see Paul, Peter, Jude, and Jesus Christ all passionately con cerned about a &ldquo;falling away,&rdquo; which means an apostasy, occurring inside the Christian Church. We might compare this apostasy to a disease entering a portion of a human body. As a result, a malignant cancer finally develops. The shocking reality is that God&rsquo;s Word has predicted a similar disease-like condition would eventually overtake a large portion of Christianity. According to 2 Thessalonians 2, as a direct result of this unhappy condition, a diabolical spiritual cancer would rise up. Paul called this cancer, &ldquo;the mystery of lawlessness&rdquo; (2 Thessalonians 2: 7).&rdquo;</p> <p>&mdash; End Time Delusions by Steve Wohlberg</p> <p>Is it too much of a stretch to wonder if the Trinity isn&rsquo;t more of a Greek myth than biblical truth? God said He would permit a great lie.

Our churches teach us that Jesus is God in the flesh, yet the Holy Scriptures clearly tell us that God sent His only begotten Son. If you place your faith in the Trinity doctrine and dismiss the clear and explicit words of God, be not deceived; you have bought into what I honestly believe is the great lie &mdash; the apostasy.</p> <p>&ldquo;The participant in opposition to the Trinity stated that he thought the Trinity was the apostasy referred to in 2 Thessalonians. In my research material, I noted another author echoing the same conclusion. I also believe it to be true. Jesus and Paul forewarned that there would be an apostasy, a falling away from the true Gospel of Christ until he returns, when true worship will be restored. Paul stated, &ldquo;For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires; and will turn away their ears from the truth, and will turn aside to myths&rdquo; (2 Timothy 4:3-4).

Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools&rdquo; (Romans 1:21-22). Paul goes on in the next few verses to describe the mindset and behaviors of those who disbelieve (see Romans 1:29-31). As a result of human foolishness and arrogant disdain of the things of God, &ldquo;God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done&rdquo; (Romans 1:28).

I humbly make this suggestion because if a Christian doesn&rsquo;t believe the explicit words of God, then what good is their faith?

Interestingly, we use &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; in English in the same way. If, in the middle of the day, someone calls a friend who is a schoolteacher, she may hear, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk now, I&rsquo;m teaching.&rdquo; In that context, &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; is being used as a verb&rdquo; the teacher is in the act of teaching. If, on the other hand, the two are walking out of church, one might say to the other, &ldquo;What did you think of the teaching?&rdquo; In that context, she is using &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; as a noun, and what she means is, &ldquo;What did you think about what we were taught?&rdquo; It is the context that determines whether didaskaliais the act of teaching or the subject matter that was taught.</p> <p>Didaskalia is used 21 times in the NT. One of the problems we have in translating from the Greek to the English is that in almost every use of didaskalia, we have to separate the act of teaching from what is taught (the doctrine). Most English versions use &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; for the act of teaching, and &ldquo;doctrine&rdquo; or &ldquo;what is taught&rdquo; for the subject matter that is taught. But in Greek there are times when the Scripture verse can easily refer to both the teaching and what is taught, (this is a kind of amphibologia.)a A good example is Titus 1:9, where we encourage with &ldquo;sound didaskalia.&rdquo; In that verse, both &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; and &ldquo;doctrine&rdquo; fit perfectly, because we encourage with sound teaching (not all teaching is &ldquo;doctrine&rdquo;), and we encourage with sound &ldquo;doctrine.&rdquo; The Greek reader instinctively sees both meanings in the word, but that is not true of English, where we usually have to make a distinction.</p>'),
