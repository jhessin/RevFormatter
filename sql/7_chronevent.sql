Then one can mathematically calculate forward and backward from that anchor date acording to what is stated in the Scriptures.</p> <p>Our anchor is the Babylon captivity (see 569 BC). The Babylonians kept very accurate records, especially concerning astronomical events. Most scholars agree with the Babylonian records regarding the dating of the 70 years of captivity. From there we count backward through the Kings to the reign of Solomon and the construction of the Temple. From that date it is 480 years backward to the exodus. Then we move backward 430 years to the calling of Abram. then we simply follow the years and dating of the people mentioned in the Old Testament untill we reach the beginning of Adam&rsquo;s 930 years of life.</p>'),

As you use this Chronology you will encounter many of these icons. If you click on the icon for the event/date/entry you are looking at, it will take you to additional information about that event/date just like it did here. Some of these additional information entries will contain hyperlinks to Wikipedia where more information regarding that event/person/place or thing can be found. By clicking on the hyperlink a new tab will open to that section of Wikipedia.</p> <p>On the far left of the Chronology there are 2 vertical columns of dates, one being BC/AD (Before Christ and Anno Domini, Latin for &ldquo;year of our Lord&rdquo;). This column is easy to understand because most everyone grew up using this dating system. Next to the BC/AD column is the second dating column, &ldquo;AH&rdquo;. AH stands for Anno Hominis (after man). It represents the years after mankind was made, formed and created. Here we make an educated assumption that Adam was created in the month of Tishri, which occurs in the fall (our September or October). However, the Gregorian calendar, the calendar in use today to which we associate BC and AD years) begins in January. This is a difference of approximately 9 months. The shift or misalignment of the 2 dating columns attempt to illustrate that shift.</p> <p>Next is the event/entry column. When a Biblical event, or an event relative to our understanding of the persons and places mentioned in the Bible occur, the box in this column adjacent to the AH year in which it occurred, will contain information. This information may include Scripture references and in many cases a link to the REV commentary for those verses. These links show up in blue letters. If you hover your cursor over the link to verses, the REV verse(s) will appear in a small pop-up window which can be scrolled up and down. When you click on the Commentary reference, you will be taken to that section of the commentary.</p> <p>You will notice that every event is color coded. Events may only occur in one particular year. However, many events span many years. For example we know from the Bible that Adam lived 930 years. So, his event color extends for 930 years along the chronology timeline from 3961 BC to 3032 BC or 1 AH to 930 AH. The color that was chosen for the life of Adam was light blue. If you hover your cursor on that colored bar in any event box from 1 AH to 930 AH information about his age will appear. This makes it easy to track multiple persons and events at the same time. There are many places where 10 to 12 events/persons are tracked in the same year.</p> <p>Every year from 3961 BC to 100 AD or 1 AH to 4061 AH is shown. This gives the user a feel for the amount of time that elapsed between events. However, you can condense this timeline by clicking on the box next to &ldquo;show only years with events&rdquo; at the top of any page of the Chronology.</p> <p>The Chronology can be navigated many different ways. Just below the phrase &ldquo;show only years with events&rdquo;, you find one button to the right that says &ldquo;Reset&rdquo;. By clicking this button, you will be taken back to 1 AH, or the beginning of the Chronology. To the left of that is a button that says &ldquo;Go&rdquo;. In the box to the left of the &ldquo;Go&rdquo; button you may type many different things to navigate. You can type any year by typing ### BC (380 bc) and click the &ldquo;Go&rdquo; button and you will be taken to that date. You can type a person&rsquo;s name such as Esther and be taken to the first entry of Esther in the Chronology (names, events like &ldquo;Exodus&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Flood&rdquo; work as well).</p> <p>Below this navigation tool you find the year corresponding to the first year on the page you are viewing. There is a drop down tab in that date box which allows you to choose a date of your choice in 50 year intervals. Next to the date box are the words &ldquo;First, Prev, Next and Last&rsquo;. These are self explanatory. By clicking on them you will be taken either to the first page, previous page, next page or the last page of the Chronology.</p> <p>You may find yourself looking at an event/date and multiple colored bars appear on the right end of the event box. When you hover your cursor over one of those colored bars information is shown. For example at 1416 BC seven different events are being tracked. One of the events is colored light green. If you hover over it you will see the words &ldquo;The 40<sup>th</sup> year of Israel in the wilderness.&rdquo; If you click on that light green bar, you will be taken to the beginning point of that event. At the beginning of any event you click on the vertical right colored bar it will take you to the end of that event.</p> <p>The chronology is divided into two parts. The first being the &ldquo;REV Biblical Chronology&rdquo;. This section covers the time period from 3961 BC to 100 AD and is based on the translation and commentary of the Revised English Version (REV).</p> <p>The second section is a chronology of &ldquo;Early Church History&rdquo; covering the time period from 100 AD to present time.</p> <p>Some dates in the Biblical chronology are impossible to completely nail down. So much historical information was lost with the destruction of the major libraries throughout the Roman Empire. Where we are unsure, we use the abbreviation of &ldquo;approx.&rdquo; to indicate the relative dating of the event. These dates could be within a 5 year range (2 years prior or after).</p> <p>Our attempt is not to be 100% precise with regards to these approx. dates, but to give the Bible student a feel for when things happened in relationship to other events, people, places and things.</p> <p>There are events which we know historically when they occurred and other events which can be calculated forward or backwards from the Scriptural evidence. These events do not include the abbreviation &ldquo;approx.&rdquo;.</p> <p>We have added pictures where we believe they will enhance your learning and add to the experience of using the chronology. All pictures are either in public domain (to the best of our knowledge) or used by permission.</p> <p>Certain information within this chronology may not agree with the conventional wisdom and thought. This chronology has not been assembled haphazardly. It is the product of many years (over 30) of intense research, digging and comparison of records and documents by several men and women including John Schoenheit, Jerry Wierwille, Sean Finnegan and others.</p> <p>One more note of explanation. All events within the chronology align with the AH years. There are times when this may appear odd and at first glance, an event may not appear that it aligns with the proper BC/AD year. This is not the case. As an example, the events surrounding the life, ministry and crucifixion of our Lord appear this way. This is due to the offset of the AH years and the BC/AD years. An explanation can be found at 26AD which reads as follows: &ldquo;At first glance, the events surrounding Jesus&rsquo; baptism, ministry, crucifixion and events following the crucifixion may appear to be occurring one AD year early. The historical events throughout this chronology are aligned with the AH year in which they occurred. This can be confusing to some as the AH years span a portion of 2 BC or AD years. AH years begin with the month of Tishri (September/October, the fall season). The BC/AD years begin with January (the winter season). That difference of approximately 9 months is represented in the columns for the BC/AD and AH years. The events that occurred during Jesus&rsquo; life, from baptism through his ascension, occurred in 27 and 28 AD (from February of 27 AD through June of 28 AD, or a span of approximately 17 months). These dates correspond with the last quarter (11<sup>th</sup> month) of 3987 AH through the first quarter (3<sup>rd</sup> month) of 3988 AH.&rdquo;</p> <p>From time to time we will add to or amend the content of the chronology, so we encourage you to check for such as time goes on.</p> <p>We appreciate, as always, your comments, suggestions, questions and feedback.</p> <p>God Bless you.</p> <p>The staff and friends of STF.</p>'),

This ship was one of the freighters that sailed the coastal waters and traveled from port to port, which is why the verse says it was about to &ldquo;sail to the places on the coast of <em>the Roman province of</em> Asia.&rdquo; Many of the ancient ships were not well prepared for deep water sailing out of the sight of land, and so made it a practice to keep the shore in sight most of the time.</p> <p>There were many things about traveling by ship that were challenging. First, there were no passenger ships until modern times. With the exception of ships that specifically carried imperial persons, every ship was a working vessel or a military ship. Anyone wanting to travel by ship had to first find a ship going in the direction they wanted, then haggle for lodging space, which was most often just a small place on the deck.</p> <p>There were no food or provisions for passengers; any passenger had to bring his own food and wine, though some ships provided water. Especially the larger ships had the equivalent of a galley where meals could be cooked, and although the crew would always have first dibs, passengers would be allowed to cook meals during off times. Travelers also had to bring anything comfortable they wanted to sleep on, and their own covering for warmth and in case of rain. They were usually allowed to pitch a little tent-like covering at night and take it down during the day. Traveling with companions was almost a necessity. They helped each other carry enough material and food for an extended voyage, stood up for each other during the almost inevitable turf wars that would arise over the best places to camp on the deck, and watched each other&rsquo;s things if someone need a walk around the deck or was sick.</p> <p>Also, ships had no set sailing schedule. They had to wait for the right tide, the right wind, and for the omens to be right as well. A bad omen would cancel sailing. Furthermore, there were days that were considered bad to start a trip (like our Friday the 13<sup>th</sup>). No skipper would leave port on days such as August 24<sup>th</sup>, October 5<sup>th</sup>, November 8<sup>th</sup>, etc.).</p> <p>Almost always the ships would travel in sight of land. Instruments like the sextant had not been invented, and it was easy to get way off course in the open ocean, so skirting the land was usually the best course of action for ships. The exception was usually some of the large grain ships that plied the ocean and ran, for example, the trip from Alexandria Egypt to Rome.</p>'),

In addition, this chart demonstrates those 2 counting systems as they relate to the 2 different calendars used by the ancients, those being a calendar year beginning with the month of Nisan and the calendar beginning with the month of Tishri. Many pagan nations utilized a Nisan calendar. When the Davidic Kingdom split into the northern 10 tribes (Israel) and the southern 2 tribes (Judah), Israel adopted the Nisan calendar and the non-accession counting system, while Judah kept the Tishri calendar. There are exceptions to this. There are times when events are reckoned according to the civil calendar (Tishri) and others according to the sacred calendar (Nisan).

Joram, King of Israel changes the accounting system of years from accession year counting to non-accession year counting. When Joram of Israel became King, the Kingdom of Judah was still using the accession system. Thus Joram is reigning 11 years in 3111 AH/850 BC, according to accession counting and 12 years according to non-accession counting. When Jehu becomes King in Joram&rsquo;s stead in 3111 AH/850 BC we see a shift, where according to both Israel and Judah, Jehu&rsquo;s reign in Israel is accredited according to a &ldquo;contemporary&rdquo; or non-accession counting system.
