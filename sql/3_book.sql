It is real history. It involves real people, real places, and a real God who is interested in, and involved with, people&rsquo;s lives. The opening verses of Ruth tell us the circumstances of the record and give us real place names and the names of people who are involved in the record or provide the background for it. Romans 15:4 tells us that the records in the Old Testament were &ldquo;written to teach us,&rdquo; and we can understand how and why that is. The God who cared about the people of the Old Testament cares about us and is involved with our lives. In learning about the events and people in the Old Testament, especially as we study them through the lens of the New Testament, we learn about God, life, and ourselves.</p> <p>The book of Ruth is the only book of the Bible named after a non-Israelite. It is named after Ruth, a woman from Moab who, after the death of her husband, traveled to Israel with her mother-in-law Naomi. Ruth is referred to as a Moabite at least a half-dozen times in Ruth, and the fact that Ruth was a non-Israelite but in the genealogy of David (and thus also the Messiah) reveals that God works with people who love and respect him regardless of background or nationality.</p> <p>We do not know who penned the book of Ruth or when it was written. Many different times have been postulated as to when Ruth was written: the time of David, of Solomon, of Josiah, of Ezra-Nehemiah, and more. Since the book mentions &ldquo;the days when the judges judged&rdquo; (Ruth 1:1), it must have been written after the time of the judges. Also, since &ldquo;David&rdquo; is mentioned in Ruth, it must have been written during or after his kingship. Also, the fact that customs such as the custom of giving a sandal in transacting a land transfer had apparently been forgotten (Ruth 4:6-8) indicates that quite a long time had passed between when the events described in Ruth happened and when Ruth was written down.</p> <p>Ruth takes place during the time of the book of Judges; in fact, it is likely that the events in Ruth took place when Deborah was judging (see commentary on Judges 4:18). Judges focuses on the cycles of Israel&rsquo;s unfaithfulness and how they moved from disobedience to God, to oppression, to deliverance, then to time of peace during which they disobeyed again. Against that backdrop, Ruth portrays the struggles and successes of a family in Israel, and shows everyday things of life such as birth, death, love, duty, marriage, and growing and harvesting crops.</p> <p>The book of Ruth has several themes and many lessons that make Ruth well worth reading and understanding. Something that is not specifically pointed out in Ruth but becomes especially clear when one reads Judges and Ruth together is the rare devotion to Yahweh that Ruth has. Ruth, a Moabite woman, leaves the gods of her family and nation and clings to Yahweh. In contrast, during her lifetime many of the people of Israel &ldquo;forsook Yahweh the God of their fathers&rdquo; and served Baal and other gods (Judg. 2:13-14). The book of Ruth thus vividly shows that faithfulness to God is a personal decision and comes from the heart, not from one&rsquo;s parents or the way a person was raised.</p> <p>One lesson in Ruth that is a common theme in the Bible is that often righteous people suffer when they do not personally deserve it. Elimelech and Naomi had a godly family, yet they suffered in the famine that was the result of the Israelites of the Judges period turning away from God (see commentary on Ruth 1:1).</p> <p>A major theme in Ruth is redemption, and various forms of the Hebrew word appear over 20 times in Ruth (cp. &ldquo;redeem,&rdquo; &ldquo;redemption,&rdquo; &ldquo;redeemer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;kinsman-redeemer&rdquo;). That being said, it is often taught that Boaz is a kinsman-redeemer and type of Christ just as Jesus was a kinsman-redeemer to those who are saved. Although Boaz and Jesus were both kinsman-redeemers, we must be cautious in stating that Boaz was a type of Christ because any relative with the means and opportunity to be a kinsman-redeemer could be one, whereas only Jesus Christ was qualified to be our Redeemer. Naomi knew she had relatives besides Boaz who qualified to be kinsmen-redeemers, and so she said to Ruth that Boaz was &ldquo;one of our kinsmen-redeemers&rdquo; (Ruth 2:20). Boaz and another relative (who is not named) are pointed out as potential kinsmen-redeemers (Ruth 3:12).</p> <p>The reason Boaz foreshadowed Jesus Christ was not that he was qualified to be a kinsman-redeemer but rather that he acted as one. It was Boaz in the role of kinsman-redeemer that foreshadowed the role that Jesus played as our kinsman-redeemer. But the fact that many of Elimelech&rsquo;s relatives could have stepped in and been a kinsman-redeemer shifts the focus to another point in the story: the unnamed man who was the closest in relation and culture should have stepped in as the kinsman-redeemer to help Ruth and Naomi, but he selfishly avoided his responsibility, whereas Boaz stepped up to help Ruth and Naomi. Thus Ruth highlights the fact that people are often in a position to help others, and some help while others avoid the responsibility. Life is such that people often need a &ldquo;kinsman-redeemer,&rdquo; someone who will step in and help them in an hour of need, and good and godly people help when and where they can and it is wise to do so.</p> <p>Ruth has many features that make it a wonderful book to read, and chief among them is the fact that for most people it parallels the theme of a difficult life now followed by blessings later. For people who are saved, life has a happy ending&mdash;being in paradise with Christ. It&rsquo;s an old saying that &ldquo;everyone loves a happy ending,&rdquo; and Ruth has one. The story in Ruth begins with hardship and ends with great blessing. Ruth also has a wonderful and detailed portrayal of women, good and godly people helping each other, and the presence of the hand of an invisible God who helps in times of need.</p> <p>Also, the reader should not lose sight of the most likely reason that the book of Ruth is in the Bible at all, that Ruth and Boaz were in the genealogy of the Lord Jesus Christ. In the many centuries that Israel existed as a nation there would have certainly been more righteous men to marry foreigners than just Boaz. After all, Salmon married Rahab the Canaanite prostitute, and there would have been many more like Boaz and Salmon. So in the union between Boaz and Ruth, and the way it happened, we see the agenda of the Author, God, in not only displaying His goodness and grace in the book of Ruth, but showing us His invisible hand at work in bringing forth King David and ultimately the Greater David, the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>'),

The Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate (which was in large part a translation of the Septuagint) have a preface to Lamentation that the Masoretic Hebrew text does not have. The NET Bible translates Greek text as &ldquo;And it came to pass after Israel had been taken captive and Jerusalem had been laid waste, Jeremiah sat weeping and lamented this lament over Jerusalem&hellip;.&rdquo; (NET Bible text note). The NET note goes on, &ldquo;Scholars generally view the preface in the LXX and Vulgate as a later addition, though the style is Hebrew rather than Greek.&rdquo; But whether this introduction was original or by a later editor, it does show that centuries before the time of Christ, the scholarly Jews attributed Lamentations to the prophet Jeremiah, and evidence in the text supports that conclusion. For the purpose of this commentary, it will be assumed that Jeremiah penned Lamentations.[fn]</p> <p>Jeremiah was a prophet of God, and a writing prophet as well; he lived at the right time period to compose the lament, i.e., through the attack on Jerusalem, and its destruction by the Babylonians. Furthermore, he personally experienced the successive waves of the Babylonian rulers carrying Judeans captive to Babylon; and he experienced personal tragedy during this whole period, including imprisonment and torture.</p> <p>Lamentations is very poetic and very carefully structured. Of the five chapters of Lamentations, each chapter is an acrostic; that is each line starts with a different letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Chapters 1, 2, and 4 start with the word <em>aycha</em>, which starts with an aleph, the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet and equivalent to our letter &ldquo;A&rdquo; (chapters 3 and 5 start with a different Hebrew word, but both chapters start with an aleph, Then, for each letter of the Hebrew alphabet, there is one verse. However, chapter three is also an alphabetical acrostic, but each letter has three verses. So Lamentations chapters 1, 2, 4, and 5 have 22 verses while Lamentations chapter 3 has 66 verses. That would lead us to think that chapter three is three times as long as chapters 1, 2, 4, and 5, but that is not the case. The verses in chapter three are much shorter than the verses in the other chapters; the occurrence of the acrostic letters occurs more often. So while on the surface chapter 3 seems to be much longer than the other chapters, actually reading it shows that it is about the same length.</p> <p>The book of Lamentations is an elegy (not to be confused with eulogy). An elegy is a poem of deep reflection, typically a lament for the dead. The first elegy in the Bible is David&rsquo;s lament over the death of Saul and his beloved friend Jonathan (2 Sam. 1:17-27). The writer of Lamentations, likely Jeremiah, seems to be an eyewitness of what he writes about because the whole elegy is written with intense and emotional language that would seem to come from personal experience and personal feelings.</p> <p>Both the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations reveal the deep feelings the writer had for Judah and Jerusalem. He writes in an intimate, tender, and even sad way, calling her the &ldquo;virgin daughter&rdquo; (Jer. 14:17; Lam. 1:15) and referring to her as a &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; many times, note especially &ldquo;Daughter Zion&rdquo; (Jer. 4:31; 6:2, 23; Lam. 1:6; 2:1,4, 8, 10, 13), &ldquo;Daughter Judah&rdquo; (Lam. 1:15; 2:2, 5), and &ldquo;Daughter Jerusalem&rdquo; (Lam. 2:13, 15; 4:22). The figurative use of &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; portrays Judah and Jerusalem as a very young woman, beloved but inexperienced and vulnerable, but at the same time the writer does not hesitate to put the blame for her tragic circumstances on her ungodly behavior and defiance of God. The bereavement of &ldquo;Daughter Jerusalem&rdquo; is also a tragedy because in a very real sense daughters were the strength of the future kingdom because only they could bear the children that would keep the society alive and strong. Judah&rsquo;s sin has brought disaster, and there is terror on every side (Jer. 6:25; 46:5; Lam. 2:22). But the writer also notes that priests and prophets have led the people astray, although he notes that the people willingly follow that ungodly lead (Jer. 5:31; 14:13-14; Lam. 2:14).</p> <p>The ability of Lamentations to get the reader in touch with the deep emotions we feel, especially in times of disaster. has led to the common practice among Jews to read the book of Lamentations in their synagogues on the ninth day of the month Av, the day and month the Temple was burned by Nebuchadnezzar.</p>'),

Amos was from the kingdom of Judah, but his message was primarily directed at the northern kingdom of Israel. Nothing is known about Amos personally except that which is in the book of Amos. He was a shepherd from Tekoa (Amos 1:1), a town in Judah about 5 miles almost due south of Bethlehem. In Amos 7:14-15, Amos states that he was not a prophet, but says, &ldquo;I was a herdsman, and a farmer of sycamore figs&rdquo; (Amos 7:14). What Amos meant by saying he was not a prophet was that he was not a professional prophet or part of a prophetic guild or school, but was personally called by God for prophetic ministry.</p> <p>It is noteworthy that Amos said he was a farmer of sycamore figs, because the sycamore fig tree does not grow in the area of Tekoa, but in the lowland, so it is possible that Amos agreed to take care of someone else&rsquo;s trees in return for grazing rights, or it is also possible that Amos was wealthy enough to own land where he grew the sycamore figs. The wide range of knowledge and vocabulary in Amos shows that he was not just a poor ignorant farmer but was educated and experienced.</p> <p>That Amos lived during the reigns of Uzziah, who reigned 52 years (2 Chron. 26:3) and Jeroboam II, who reigned 41 years (2 Kings 14:23) gives us a basic time frame in which Amos lived. Also, in Amos 7:17, Amos predicts that Amaziah, a priest in Bethel, would be carried captive to an unclean land, his wife would have to prostitute herself to live, and his sons and daughters would die by the sword. Those events would have occurred in and after 722 BC when Assyria conquered Samaria and carried Israel captive to Assyria. All the datable events in Amos lead to a suggested date for his ministry somewhere in the area of 765-750 BC.</p> <p>The early years of the eighth century BC brought hope and prosperity to both the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The Assyrians captured Syria around 800 BC and thus brought that ancient enemy of Israel to an end, but Assyria itself suffered internal struggles and was unable to pressure Israel and Judah, and to the south, Egypt had problems as well. At that time, two powerful and brilliant military leaders arose as kings: Jeroboam II in Israel and Azariah (also called Uzziah) in Judah. Their long reigns allowed for a period of stability and prosperity in Judah and Israel that had not been seen since Solomon and Israel in particular conquered territory in the north. At the same time, however, the blessings of prosperity brought increasing moral decay, and especially for Israel, prophetic warnings that Israel would be destroyed, which came to pass in 722 BC.</p> <p>During that time, Israel went further and further away from Yahweh and followed Baal and other pagan gods. The cult of Baal was heavily involved in ritual sex, which was directly opposed to the holiness in God&rsquo;s law and also destroyed family bonds. Also, pagan gods were generally capricious and violent, and that affected society as well. Reading Amos and the other prophets of that time shows a growing disparity between the rich and the poor, and a lack of concern on the part of the rich for the welfare of the poor, in fact, many rich people preyed on the poor to enrich themselves. God&rsquo;s concern for the poor and disadvantaged, which is so prominent in the Mosaic Law, was not part of the pagan religions, and that was certainly reflected in Israel and Judah as they became more and more pagan.</p> <p>God&rsquo;s love for His people can be seen in the fact that matching the moral decay going on in Israel and Judah were God&rsquo;s attempts to call the people back to Himself, because He raised up bold and powerful writing prophets at that time: Amos, Isaiah, Hosea, and Micah. Also, there were other prophets at that time as well who did not write about Israel and Judah, such as Jonah. Sadly, both Israel and Judah ignored the warnings of the prophets, and both kingdoms were destroyed, Israel first in 722 BC, then Judah later in 586 BC. However, not everyone ignored the Law and the warnings of the prophets. The personal example and powerful words of the prophets encouraged a small but committed number of people to walk in obedience to God and hope for the better times in the future that the prophets spoke about, but no one expected that those better times would still be future today, more than 2,700 years after Amos wrote. So believers today, just as believers back then, wait patiently in trust and hope for the prophecies of a wonderful future to come to pass.</p>'),

Nothing is known about the Obadiah who penned the book of Obadiah except that he was a prophet called by God. Some Christian tradition identifies the prophet Obadiah with the Obadiah of Elijah&rsquo;s time who hid the prophets in a cave, but that is just tradition and is almost certainly too early for the two Obadiahs to be the same. Obadiah the prophet lived much later than Elijah.</p> <p>The date of Obadiah is not given in the book of Obadiah and so even conservative scholars differ, and suggested dates range from the ninth to sixth century BC. However, the content of the book argues strongly for a date for what was written in the book soon after the destruction of Jerusalem by Babylon in 586 BC. However, it is likely that Obadiah wrote later than that, and thus wrote about events that happened earlier. But even so, it does not seem like he would have written much later than the events he describes in the book, thus sometime between 586 and 500 BC.</p> <p>Although the date of Obadiah&rsquo;s prophecy is debated, the message is the same no matter what the exact background. Edom, which was often representative of all enemy nations, was against God and His people, and even though God&rsquo;s enemies persecute God&rsquo;s people and inflict terrible harm upon them, the Day of Yahweh is coming in which the enemies of God will be destroyed and God&rsquo;s people will be vindicated and established back in the Promised Land. The overall prophetic message that God&rsquo;s enemies will be destroyed and God&rsquo;s people vindicated occurs in a number of the prophetic books, although many prophecies do not speak of the whole picture, but give only a piece of what is coming (cp.

He was born in Babylonia during the Babylonian Captivity, and returned to Judah under the leadership of Zerubbabel. His grandfather Iddo (Zech. 1:1) is named in Nehemiah 12:4 as one of the people who returned to Judah. Zechariah was a contemporary of Haggai (Ezra 5:1; 6:14), but continued his ministry long after him (Zech. 1:1; 7:1; Hag. 1:1; Neh. 12:1-16). Zechariah was young when his prophetic ministry started (Zech. 2:4).</p> <p>A major part of Zechariah&rsquo;s ministry was reproving and encouraging the people of Judah to be godly and also to rebuild the Temple of Yahweh (cp. Zech 1:1-6; 4:8-10). Also, however, Zechariah has wonderful prophecies about the coming Messiah. He foretold that the Messiah would be a man, and called him &ldquo;the man who is close to me [Yahweh]&rdquo; (Zech. 13:7), and &ldquo;the man whose name is &lsquo;the Branch&rdquo; (Zech. 6:12). Zechariah foretold the Messiah rule would be greater than just Judah, and said that he would &ldquo;branch out of his place,&rdquo; and also that he would build the Temple of Yahweh (Zech. 6:12-13: the Temple the Messiah will build is the Millennial Temple described in Ezekiel 40-44). Zechariah said nations would come to Jerusalem to worship and celebrate the feast of Tabernacles, and Yahweh&rsquo;s &ldquo;house&rdquo; (the Temple) will contain pots and decorations marked &ldquo;holy to Yahweh&rdquo; (Zech. 14:16-21). Zechariah also foretold that the Messiah would be both the king and the High Priest (Zech. 6:13). In fact, when the Messiah came to be king he would have a worldwide dominion (Zech. 9:9-10; 14:9, 16). Zechariah foretold that the Messiah would be struck with the sword of Yahweh and that his followers would be scattered (Zech. 13:7), and furthermore that his hands were wounded by his friends (Zech. 13:6), and he would be &ldquo;pierced&rdquo; (Zech. 12:10). Nevertheless, he would come and conquer the earth (Zech. 14:4). When the Messiah, God&rsquo;s servant the Branch, reigned as king there would be peace on earth (Zech. 3:8-10; 9:9-10). There is also an obscure prophecy that the Messiah would be sold for 30 pieces of silver (Zech. 11:12-13).</p> <p>Besides the prophecy of the Temple that the Messiah would build, there are many other end-time things Zechariah spoke about. For example, he spoke about the tribulation time before Christ conquers the earth when the nations of the earth would attack Israel (Zech. 12:1-3; 14:1-2). He also foretold that the Messiah would defeat those nations (Zech. 12:2-9; 14:3-4). He foretold some of the geographical changes that the world would go through when the Messiah ruled the earth (Zech. 14:4-5),</p>'),

Paul discloses that he has just completed receiving the offering from the churches in Macedonia and Achaia for the poor believers in Jerusalem (Rom. 15:25-29). The time of composition seems to best correspond to approximately a year after Paul left Ephesus during his third missionary journey (cf. Acts 20:1-3).</p> <p><strong>Recipient(s):</strong> To all the believers in Rome (Rom. 1:7). It is interesting that Paul does not address this letter to the &ldquo;church&rdquo; in Rome like he does in several of his other letters. In fact, we know very little about the believers living in Rome at this time, but we know that the emergence of the Christian community there was not founded by Paul himself. Nevertheless, two things are apparent about the community in Rome. First, by the time Paul wrote this letter, the believers in Rome had become well-known for their faith among the other churches in the world (Rom. 1:8). Second, at the end of the letter, Paul identifies and sends greetings to no less than 26 individuals and many others in the community at Rome (Rom. 16:1-16). This indicates that he was acquainted with a number of the believers who were residents of Rome and participated in the churches there.</p> <p><strong>Biblical Canon:</strong> The Letter to the Romans is placed after the Acts of the Apostles as the first letter in a collection of letters (often called &ldquo;Church Epistles&rdquo;) written by the apostle Paul to early Christian communities, many of which he had founded during his missionary journeys. Romans is not the first letter Paul wrote but is nonetheless the longest of his letters and the most systematic. Perhaps on account of these features, it was placed first at the beginning of the NT letters. Throughout Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;Church Letters,&rdquo; he provides doctrine, reproof, and correction for churches to guide them in the Christian faith and to reveal to them the understanding he had received by revelation concerning the administration of God&rsquo;s grace, the gift of the holy spirit, God&rsquo;s secret plan for the joining together of both Jew and Gentile in Christ&rsquo;s body, the promise of redemption and salvation, and practical instruction for proper Christian behavior both inside and outside the church.</p> <p><strong>Background:</strong> It is unknown who first brought the Good News to Rome, but perhaps some of the Jewish &ldquo;visitors from Rome&rdquo; present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:10) were converted and brought the message back to their home city afterward (c. <span style="font-size:110%;font-variant:small-caps;">ad</span> 30). Nothing is really known about the emergence of the community in Rome or its constitution or practices.</p> <p>However, something was certainly stirring in Rome, because in <span style="font-size:110%;font-variant:small-caps;">ad</span> 49 the Roman Emperor Claudius ordered all Jews to leave Rome, including all Jewish Christians (Acts 18:2). According to the Roman historian Suetonius, this edict was caused by the continued strife and agitation among the Jews over a certain person referred to as &ldquo;Chrestus&rdquo; [i.e., Christ], and therefore, Emperor Claudius expelled them all from Rome. It is not known if the disturbances were between Jews and Christians, but it is highly likely that the conflicts were produced by the growing Christian population in Rome and increasing tension with Jewish leaders.</p> <p>Claudius&rsquo; ban against Jews in Rome lasted several years but was revoked by at least <span style="font-size:110%;font-variant:small-caps;">ad</span> 53. By the time Paul wrote this letter, many Jews and Jewish Christians had returned to Rome. Even though Paul had never visited Rome (Rom. 1:13), during his missionary travels he had come into contact with a number of believers from Rome, such as Priscilla and Aquila (Rom. 16:3-4; cf. Acts 18:2). Also, according to the farewell greetings given by Paul in Romans 16, it seems that Paul had come to know quite a few believers in Rome while on his travels. Moreover, his description of those he sent greetings to in Rome indicates there was probably not one large church but several smaller groups there. That is very understandable given the size of the city of Rome and the large population, which was likely close to one million people during the lifetime of Paul. The early Christian movement was structured with churches meeting in people&rsquo;s homes, and it seems like there was already a network of house churches in Rome by the time Paul wrote.</p> <p><strong>Purpose for Writing:</strong> Paul&rsquo;s purpose for writing this letter to the believers in Rome was multifaceted. First, Paul wanted to form stronger bonds with the churches in Rome, convey his intention to visit and fellowship with them for a while, and also be assisted by them financially in his prospective evangelistic efforts in the West (Rom. 15:22-32). Paul had desired to travel to Rome on many occasions but had been unable to up to that point in his ministry (Rom. 1:13; 15:23). He now aspired to travel to Spain and preach the good news there, and he wanted to stop and see the believers in Rome on his way in order to have a fruitful ministry among them and to be mutually encouraged and refreshed by them (Rom. 1:11-13; 15:32). Furthermore, Paul likely saw Rome as a good base of operations for his missionary work in the West, much like Antioch was during his missionary journeys throughout Asia Minor and Greece.</p> <p>Second, during the expulsion of the Jews from Rome, the Christian churches would have become predominantly Gentile Christians. Upon the return of the Jewish Christians to Rome, a tension seemed to have arisen between the two groups concerning matters of continuity and discontinuity with Jewish traditions and the Christian faith. Therefore, Paul expounds in detail the message of the good news which he preached in hopes that this would alleviate misconceptions and settle disputes between Jewish and Gentile Christians in Rome. Paul mentions his eagerness to preach to the believers in Rome (Rom. 1:15), and so before his arrival, he endeavors to set forth a declaration of the good news in greater detail in this letter more than in any other.</p> <p>Paul&rsquo;s intention in laying out a robust defense of the good news was also to establish the foundation of his message against attacks from people who were attempting to undermine the teaching of the Christian faith and his ministry (Rom. 16:17-18). Paul does not directly identify these offenders and instigators but exhorts the believers in Rome to be on the lookout for them and avoid them.</p> <p><strong>Message:</strong> In broad terms, Paul&rsquo;s letter to the Romans can be viewed as being divided into two major halves. The first half of the letter focuses on God&rsquo;s faithfulness in bringing about his plan of redemption for humankind (Rom. 1:1-11:36), and the second half focuses on the practical outworking of God&rsquo;s righteousness within the community of God&rsquo;s people (Rom. 12:1-15:13). Within each of these halves, Paul develops and expounds on several major themes. On several occasions, Paul uses the well-known ancient rhetorical writing style called &ldquo;diatribe,&rdquo; where he raises questions that an imaginary opponent might ask based on what he has said and then proceed to answer them. In addition, the logic of his argumentation is often compact and abbreviated as he tends to move quickly and not fully explain every premise or idea. It is almost as if he assumes his audience shares the same background context and understanding as he does. Below is a brief overview of his letter and the major themes and ideas he presents.</p> <p>After an extended introduction (Rom. 1:1-15), Paul delivers what could be called his thesis for the letter (Rom. 1:16-17): the good news is about the righteousness that has been revealed through God&rsquo;s Son, Jesus Christ. It is this good news that has the power to bring salvation to everyone who believes, whether Jew or Gentile. This message of salvation is indeed good news, as Paul proceeds to paint a vivid picture of the universal sinfulness and guilt of all humanity&mdash;both Jew and Gentile (Rom. 1:18-3:31). According to God&rsquo;s plan of redemption for all humankind, God has set forth Jesus to be a sacrifice for sin so that God would be righteous and could declare righteous the one who believes in Jesus (Rom. 3:24-26).</p> <p>Now, if salvation is for the Jew and Gentile on the basis of trusting in Jesus, then one question that would be raised is whether the blessing of salvation was meant for the Jew on account of the Law and the sign of circumcision (Rom. 4:9-12). Paul explains that the promise of salvation was given to Abraham before the Law and circumcision, and therefore righteousness is not based on the Law but on trust, so that the promise might be guaranteed to all of Abraham&rsquo;s descendants who share the trust that Abraham had in God who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead (Rom. 4:13-25).</p> <p>Everyone who believes is justified by the blood of Jesus and receives reconciliation with God (Rom. 5:1-11). To explain how this has come about, Paul gives the narrative backstory on how death entered through Adam&rsquo;s sin, and then how life entered through Christ&rsquo;s righteousness. And thus, those who believe should consider themselves to be dead to sin but alive to God (Rom. 5:12-6:11). Therefore, those who have received new life in Christ are no longer slaves of sin but are now slaves of God, being free to serve in the new way of the spirit and not the old way of the Law (Rom. 6:12-7:6).</p> <p>After a brief discussion on the role of the Law and its purpose in revealing the power of sin (Rom. 7:7-25), Paul presents God&rsquo;s solution in Christ where the Law is fulfilled by those who walk according to the spirit, and through that spirit they are to put to death the deeds of the flesh and live in the freedom of the glorious liberty of the children of God, eagerly awaiting the redemption of their bodies (Rom. 8:1-30). In an exuberant and escalading climax, Paul conveys how believers have received the victory in Christ and have triumphed over all possible obstacles, leaving nothing that could ever separate them from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus (Rom. 8:31-39).</p> <p>In light of God&rsquo;s plan of salvation culminating in the inclusion of the Gentiles with the Jews as one people of God, Paul addresses the tension between God&rsquo;s faithfulness and Jewish unfaithfulness by arguing that: 1) God&rsquo;s word has not failed despite his rejection of Israel (Rom. 9:1-29), 2) Israel&rsquo;s failure to obtain righteousness through trust and their rejection of the good news is the cause of their exclusion in what God is now doing among the Gentiles (Rom. 9:30-10:21), and 3) God has not cast off Israel completely or finally, but their hardening is being used for the purpose of bringing salvation to the Gentiles in order to make Israel jealous (Rom. 11:1-32).</p> <p>On account of the right relationship believers now have with God, Paul enters into a discussion on the practical significance of walking by the spirit with a renewed mind in response to God&rsquo;s mercy and grace (Rom. 12:1-2). God has given a variety of gifts according to his grace, which believers are to use in service to one another in the body of Christ, but also believers are to demonstrate love to everyone outside the body as well (Rom. 12:3-21). Paul delineates a Christian&rsquo;s duty to governing authorities (Rom. 13:1-7), and how the commandment to love your neighbor fulfills the whole law (Rom. 13:8-10). Therefore, believers are to walk as children of light and to not fulfill the desires of the flesh (Rom. 13:11-14)</p> <p>In other practical matters, Paul discusses issues concerning Jewish observance of food and days with the admonition that love does no wrong to their neighbor, and so believers should be considerate, respectful, and not judge one another because both Jewish and Gentile believers honor the Lord in their respective ways, and each person will eventually give an account of themselves to God (Rom. 14:1-12). Thus, no one should put a cause for stumbling in the way of another believer, but every believer should be more concerned with the well-being of others than themselves (Rom. 14:13-15:6). As a result of the freedom in Christ, both Jews and Gentiles are equally accepted by God and therefore should accept one another so that both may glorify God together for his promises and mercy (Rom. 15:7-13).</p> <p>In his conclusion, Paul makes mention of his role as apostle to the Gentiles and, now that his work around the Eastern Mediterranean is complete, his intention is to come to Rome right after he delivers an offering to the believers in Jerusalem (Rom. 15:14-33). Paul&rsquo;s closing remarks in this letter are the longest of his letters because he sends greetings to a large number of individuals as well as a few farewell remarks from those currently with him, and he also includes a final warning not to associate with individuals who do not serve Christ but their own appetites (Rom. 16:1-24).</p>'),
(46, 1, '1 Corinthians', '1 Cor', 16, 'The First Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians', 46, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, '1Co', '~1corinthians~1co~1cor~1c~', null, null, '<p><strong>Author:</strong> God (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:21), who inspired the apostle Paul (1 Cor. 1:1; 16:21), who then dictated the letter to an unnamed secretary, who transcribed it for him (cf. 1 Cor. 16:21).</p> <p><strong>Date:</strong> Written most likely in the spring of AD 54 or 55 but could have been as late as the spring of AD 56. The letter was probably written in the city of Ephesus in Turkey during Paul&rsquo;s three-year visit there just before the festival of Pentecost (1 Cor. 16:8; Acts 20:31). The time of composition correlates to sometime in the beginning of Paul&rsquo;s third missionary journey when he learned about some of the issues in the church in Corinth.</p> <p><strong>Audience:</strong> To all the believers in the church at Corinth, as well as every person who calls upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord (1 Cor. 1:2). The recipients of this letter consisted of those believers who Paul had converted during his first visit when he stayed in the city for over 18 months, evangelizing and teaching (Acts 18:11). Paul describes the Corinthian believers as having been enriched in all things and not lacking any spiritual gift (1 Cor. 1:5-7). Furthermore, according to the issues that Paul addresses, it seems the church was very socially, economically, and ethnically diverse. This is not surprising as Corinth was one of the largest commerce centers in the Roman Empire.</p> <p>Paul specifically addresses issues concerning the relations between Jew and Gentile (1 Cor. 8:7-12), wealthy and poor (1 Cor. 11:19-21), married and unmarried (1 Cor. 7:8-16), and slave and free (1 Cor. 7:21-23). This reflects the type of diverse community that made up the church community in Corinth. Much of Paul&rsquo;s letter deals with how aspects of the culture in Corinth were negatively affecting the church and the faith of the believers there. Paul even accuses them of being &ldquo;unspiritual,&rdquo; saying they are still not ready for &ldquo;solid food&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:1-4). Thus, Paul describes the Corinthian believers as still being immature and in need of further instruction.</p> <p><strong>Biblical Canon:</strong> The First Letter to the Corinthians is placed after the Letter to the Romans as the second of Paul&rsquo;s letters in the collection known as the &ldquo;Church Epistles&rdquo; to early Christian communities, many of which he had founded during his missionary journeys. First Corinthians was written before Romans but is nonetheless placed after it in the collection of Paul&rsquo;s letters in the NT. It is one of Paul&rsquo;s longer letters that deals with numerous issues concerning proper Christian conduct both individually and collectively as the church (e.g., issues concerning personal sanctification as well as communal worship and other practices in the church).</p> <p>As with many of Paul&rsquo;s other &ldquo;Church Letters,&rdquo; he weaves together doctrine, reproof, and correction in order to guide the believers in their faith and to reveal to them the understanding he had received by revelation concerning the administration of grace, the gift of the holy spirit, God&rsquo;s secret plan for the joining together of both Jew and Gentile in the church, the promise of redemption and salvation, and proper Christian behavior both inside and outside the church.</p> <p><strong>Background:</strong> The first time Paul visited Corinth was toward the end of his second missionary journey after leaving Athens in c. AD 51-52 (cf. Acts 18:1-17). At that time, Corinth was still a rather newly established Roman city. Although it was destroyed in 146 BC, it was refounded in 44 BC by Julius Caesar as a colony where many retired veterans were sent to live. Another reason Corinth was refounded was because it was a major crossroads in the Roman Empire. It was a major seaport city that facilitated a lot of trade and mixing of cultures since it was a midway point between the East and West sides of the Empire. As a strategic seaport, Corinth was located on a narrow isthmus connecting mainland Greece to the Peloponnese and divided the Saronic Gulf (an inlet to the Aegean Sea) from the Gulf of Corinth (an inlet to the Ionian Sea). The isthmus is less than 4 miles (6.4 km) across, and the Romans built a paved track to transport smaller boats and goods between the Aegean and Adriatic Seas. This saved sailing hundreds of miles through dangerous waters around the southern tip of Greece and contributed greatly to Corinth being an important and cosmopolitan city.</p> <p>And so, being a prominent seafaring city, Corinth was full of the typical characteristics of a port: an abundance of food, entertainment, and promiscuous women. Long before Paul arrived there, the promiscuous culture of Corinth was so well-known that several ancient writers coined terms with the base word &ldquo;Corinth&rdquo; to describe various sexual behaviors and appetites (e.g., &ldquo;a Corinthian girl&rdquo; was a label used to describe a loose woman or prostitute). While this promiscuous culture is noted long before the time of Paul, it is likely that Corinth&rsquo;s notorious reputation was still accurate during Paul&rsquo;s lifetime.</p> <p>Upon arriving in Corinth, Paul preached in the synagogue and was met with much resistance (Acts 18:3-6). However, the Lord told Paul to continue speaking, for there were many people in the city who would believe (Acts 18:9-11). After remaining in Corinth for a year and a half, Paul departed, leaving behind a group of many believers, including Crispus, who had been a synagogue leader, and Titius Justus (Acts 18:7-8, 11). But much work of the ministry in Corinth was taken over by Apollos, who came over from Ephesus after Paul left (1 Cor. 3:6; 16:12; Acts 18:27-19:1). There was also a believer named Erastus in Corinth, who was the city treasurer that Paul mentions in his Letter to the Romans (Rom. 16:23). This Erastus may be the same as the &ldquo;Erastus&rdquo; mentioned on a first-century AD inscription discovered in Corinth near a paved area northeast of the Corinthian theater.</p> <p>It is known from 1 Corinthians 5:9 that the letter of 1 Corinthians was not Paul&rsquo;s first letter to the Corinthian church. It appears the Corinthian community was in contact with Paul, and Paul had corresponded on several matters with them previously. In addition, Paul appears to allude in several places to the contents of a letter that he received from them (1 Cor. 7:1, 25; 8:1; 12:1; 16:1). The multiple correspondence between Paul and the church in Corinth was likely due to the frequent sea traffic between the major seaports of Ephesus and Corinth, thus permitting Paul and the Corinthians to communicate more rapidly.</p> <p><strong>Purpose for Writing:</strong> First Corinthians should be read as part of an ongoing conversation between Paul and the believers in Corinth. As mentioned above, the letter of 1 Corinthians was not Paul&rsquo;s first correspondence with the Corinthian church. From Paul&rsquo;s statement in 1 Corinthians 5:9, the letter we call &ldquo;1 Corinthians&rdquo; is Paul&rsquo;s second letter to Corinth.</p> <p>The specific occasion for which Paul penned this letter to the believers in Corinth was prompted by rising problems in the church there. Paul discloses at the beginning of the letter how he became informed of these problems when news reached his ears through members of Chloe&rsquo;s household, and a major problem that runs through the entire letter is division (1 Cor. 1:11-15). This division among the people is partially understandable given the diverse backgrounds of the people in the church in Corinth, but it shows up throughout the whole letter. There was jealousy and strife (1 Cor. 3:3), people criticizing Paul (1 Cor. 4:3-4, 18-19; 9:1-3), the believers suing each other in court (1 Cor. 6:1-8), and some believers not being sensitive to the views of others in the church (1 Cor. 8:7-13; 10:25-33). He also alludes to hearing of other problems in the church such as sexual immorality (1 Cor. 5:1), neglecting the needs of some at the Lord&rsquo;s Supper (1 Cor. 11:18-22), and confusion over the resurrection (1 Cor. 15:12). Furthermore, Paul also responds to concerns that the Corinthians had written him about in a prior letter (cf. 1 Cor. 7:1, 25; 8:1; 12:1; 16:1).</p> <p>Therefore, this letter to the Corinthians was prompted by the need for practical correction concerning the alarming behavior of the Corinthians that Paul had learned about as well as Paul&rsquo;s pastoral and apostolic instruction concerning the matters that the Corinthian church had inquired about through their letter to him.</p> <p>As Paul&rsquo;s style typically is in most of his letters, he often mentions the premise for his letter in his introduction and his prayer for the recipient. At the outset, Paul addresses his letter to the Corinthian believers but also mentions everyone who calls upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, &ldquo;both their Lord and ours&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:2). In addition, at the conclusion of his opening prayer, Paul reminds the Corinthians that they were all called by God into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord (1 Cor. 1:9).</p> <p>Throughout the letter, Paul points to this overarching theme of the collective joining of all believers to the Lord Jesus and his universal lordship and authority in their lives. Thus, Paul&rsquo;s objective is to persuade the Corinthians to recognize that they are all &ldquo;owned by&rdquo; and have been united with Jesus Christ as part of his body, and that reality should be reflected in their faith and practice.</p> <p>Overall, the letter is Paul&rsquo;s instruction about, and warning against, the various wrong practices that the Corinthian church was involved in. In the letter, Paul bares his concern for the community in Corinth regarding all these perils that were affecting their faith in God, their love for one another, their public worship, and their Christian witness.</p> <p><strong>Message:</strong> Paul&rsquo;s first letter to the Corinthians can be viewed as a series of instructive responses to oral reports about, and written communication from, the Corinthians. After the introduction and opening prayer of the letter, Paul launches right into addressing the pressing matters about the problems stirring in the church in Corinth.</p> <p>One way to view the content of Paul&rsquo;s letter is to see him alternating between responding to matters he has heard through oral reports and answering questions posed in a previous letter he received from the Corinthians.</p> <p style="padding-left: 2%">Oral Reports (1:10-4:21 / 5:1-6:20)<br /> &nbsp; Corinthian Letter (7:1-40 / 8:1-11:1)<br /> Oral Reports (11:2-34)<br /> &nbsp; Corinthian Letter (12:1-14:40)<br /> Oral Reports (15:1-58)<br /> &nbsp; Corinthian Letter (16:1-12)</p> <p>In the first section (1 Cor. 1:10-4:21), Paul addresses the problem of quarreling factions in the Corinthian community, which he was informed about by some people in Chloe&rsquo;s household (1 Cor. 1:11-13). The problem arose because certain Corinthian believers were claiming to be identified with various prominent leaders in the Christian church. This led to divisions and strife among the church members instead of promoting the unity that Christ has established in the church. Paul reminds the Corinthians that God&rsquo;s wisdom contained in the good news is unlike the wisdom they were familiar with in the Greco-Roman world, and that the good news did, in fact, contain wisdom but not a type they were used to hearing (1 Cor. 1:18-2:16). In addition, this wisdom encapsulated the secret plan of God that was not known in past ages (1 Cor. 2:6-8), and it is a wisdom not taught by humans, but by the spirit of God (1 Cor. 2:10).</p> <p>The rivalries among believers stemmed from people vastly overestimating their own importance, and thus Paul corrects their misunderstanding by explaining the unified purpose and role of the servants of God (1 Cor. 3:5-17). Since the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God, each person should recognize that they are a servant and that everyone belongs to Christ, and Christ belongs to God (1 Cor. 3:18-23). Paul ends this section with an admonition against being inflated with pride, and that the manner in which he comes to visit them will be dependent upon their future conduct (1 Cor. 4:6-21).</p> <p>In another report that reached Paul&rsquo;s ears, he learns about some moral and ethical issues in which the Corinthians were being negligent (1 Cor. 5:1-6:20). First, Paul addresses the practice of sexual immorality happening among the Corinthians, using the report of a man sleeping with his father&rsquo;s wife as a case example (1 Cor. 5:1-8). The negligence of the Corinthians is exposed when Paul reiterates that, according to his previous letter, this kind of behavior was exactly what he stipulated should not be tolerated in the community (1 Cor. 5:9). Therefore, Paul declares for the Corinthians to purge this sin from among them and not to associate with believers who practice sin (1 Cor. 5:10-13). In the second and third issues in this section, Paul brings up two other incompatible practices with Christian holiness: 1) bringing lawsuits against each other before unbelieving judges (1 Cor. 6:1-11), and 2) the sanctity of Christ&rsquo;s and the believer&rsquo;s body and the defilement of sexual immorality (1 Cor. 6:12-20).</p> <p>Paul then turns to address two serious matters that the Corinthians had brought up in their previous letter to him. In response to their concerns, Paul offers instruction and advice on the matters of marriage and to those who are unmarried (1 Cor. 7:1-40), and the problems that have come about because of opposing views regarding eating meat that has been sacrificed to idols (8:1-11:1). Interspersed in Paul&rsquo;s address about food sacrificed to idols is a discussion about Paul&rsquo;s apostolic example (1 Cor. 9:1-27), the error of idolatry (1 Cor. 10:1-22), and the meaning of Christian freedom (1 Cor. 10:23-11:1).</p> <p>In the next section (1 Cor. 11:2-14:40), Paul talks about issues concerning public worship that relate to problems with how the Corinthians were conducting themselves in church meetings. Three paramount issues seem to be plaguing the Corinthian church: 1) the meaning of head coverings (1 Cor. 11:2-16), 2) the celebration of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper (1 Cor. 11:17-34), and 3) the use of spiritual gifts and manifestations (1 Cor. 12:1-14:40). Within the discussion on spiritual gifts, Paul includes a lengthy digression on the meaning of love and how it relates to the proper operation of and perspective about spiritual gifts (1Cor. 13:1-13). Throughout the section as a whole, Paul focuses on the collective functioning of the Corinthian community because some divisions had sprouted up over these matters when the church gathered together, and these conflicts were not good (1 Cor. 11:18; 12:25; 14:26).</p> <p>In the last major section of the letter (1 Cor. 15:1-58), Paul is eager to reiterate to the Corinthians the essentiality of the resurrection of Christ for the validity and meaning of the good news (1 Cor. 15:1-11), the Christian faith (1 Cor. 15:12-19), and the hope of future resurrection (1 Cor. 15:20-58). Paul defends the legitimacy of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and its purpose in God&rsquo;s plan of redemption and salvation because it has been reported to him that some of the Corinthians are denying the truth of a future bodily resurrection of the believers (1 Cor. 15:12). This accusation fundamentally undermines the life, ministry, and death of Jesus Christ. The Corinthians are also questioning what sort of body believers will be raised with (1 Cor. 15:35). Paul assures them that it will not be a body like their weak, earthly bodies but rather a powerful, heavenly body like Christ&rsquo;s (1 Cor. 15:42-49).</p> <p>Paul ends his letter by encouraging the Corinthians to continue to prepare a collection for the poor believers in Jerusalem (1 Cor. 16:1-4), and also conveys his intent to visit them soon, if the Lord permits (1 Cor. 16:5-12). Paul also gives greetings to the Corinthians from various believers, including specifically Aquila and Priscilla, who were residing in Corinth when Paul first arrived (1 Cor. 16:13-24; cf. Acts 18:1-2).</p>'),
(47, 1, '2 Corinthians', '2 Cor', 13, 'The Second Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians', 47, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, '2Co', '~2corinthians~2co~2cor~2c~', null, null, '<p><strong>Author:</strong> God (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:21), who inspired the apostle Paul (2 Cor. 1:1; 10:1) to write the letter.</p> <p><strong>Date:</strong> Probably written in <span style="font-size:110%;font-variant:small-caps;">ad</span> 56 from Macedonia, most likely in Philippi (2 Cor. 2:13; 7:5; Acts 20:1). Paul had left Ephesus and met up with Titus in Macedonia and learned from him about how the Corinthian church was doing. This was during his third missionary journey, on which he would eventually continue to travel throughout Greece, visiting again Corinth and the other churches he founded before finally heading to Jerusalem, where he was arrested and put in jail (Acts 20:1-3, 13-16; 21:27-33; cf. 2 Cor. 12:14).</p> <p>The dating of Paul&rsquo;s second letter to the Corinthians has to accommodate the time necessary for all the events described after he wrote 1 Corinthians to occur. It is estimated that 2 Corinthians was written approximately 9-12 months after he wrote 1 Corinthians.</p> <p><strong>Audience:</strong> To all the believers in the church at Corinth, as well as all the believers in Achaia, southern Greece (2 Cor. 1:1). Paul had almost certainly become acquainted with many of the recipients of this letter during his first visit to Corinth when he stayed in the city for 18 months, witnessing and teaching (Acts 18:11).</p> <p><strong>Biblical Canon:</strong> This second letter is collected together with Paul&rsquo;s first letter to the Corinthians and is listed among the collection of writings known as the &ldquo;Church Epistles&rdquo; that Paul wrote to several early Christian communities, many of which he had founded during his missionary journeys. The Epistle of 2 Corinthians is aptly titled as a subsequent correspondence between Paul and the church in Corinth, and as such, the content of 2 Corinthians follows chronologically upon what was written in 1 Corinthians.</p> <p>As with many of Paul&rsquo;s other &ldquo;Church Letters,&rdquo; he weaves together doctrine, reproof, and correction in order to guide the believers in their faith and to reveal to them the understanding he had received by revelation concerning the administration of grace, the gift of the holy spirit, God&rsquo;s secret plan for the joining together of both Jew and Gentile in the church, the promise of redemption and salvation, and proper Christian behavior both inside and outside the church.</p> <p><strong>Background:</strong> In 2 Corinthians 2:1, Paul alludes to a second visit he made to Corinth, which he describes as a &ldquo;sorrowful&rdquo; or &ldquo;painful&rdquo; visit. If Paul wrote 1 Corinthians in <span style="font-size:110%;font-variant:small-caps;">ad</span> 55, then sometime in the year between <span style="font-size:110%;font-variant:small-caps;">ad</span> 55 and the composition of 2 Corinthians in <span style="font-size:110%;font-variant:small-caps;">ad</span> 56 he returned to Corinth and was devastated by the circumstances he encountered there. This trip would not have been difficult to make because both Corinth and Ephesus were port cities and there was lots of boat traffic across the Aegean Sea between the two cities.</p> <p>It seems that the Corinthian church did not receive the letter of 1 Corinthians well and was still greatly troubled and plagued by many of the problems Paul had tried to address. Thus, sometime during Paul&rsquo;s ministry efforts in Ephesus, he returned to Corinth for a second visit. Unfortunately, this visit is not mentioned in Acts 19, but Paul mentions it in 2 Corinthians and makes explicitly clear that he does not want to come and see them again under those same circumstances (2 Cor. 2:1; 13:2).</p> <p>Furthermore, Paul also mentions a letter he wrote in tears after departing from this painful second visit to Corinth (2 Cor. 2:3-4). What this indicates is that in the course of his time in Ephesus, Paul had written a subsequent letter after 1 Corinthians in response to the disintegrating state of the Corinthian church he discovered when he visited the second time.</p> <p>This letter is described by Paul as one which was written &ldquo;with many tears&rdquo; and &ldquo;out of an extremely troubled and anguished heart&rdquo; (2 Cor. 2:4). The content of this letter is unknown, but it was most certainly a harsh letter filled with stern rebuke concerning the Corinthians because Paul declares how he came to learn that the letter grieved them and produced such deep longing, sorrow, and zeal in them (2 Cor. 7:7-10).</p> <p>Before being able to visit a third time, Paul decided to send Titus to Corinth, probably having him deliver the &ldquo;tearful letter.&rdquo; Titus then returned to Paul and reported back about how it was received and the present state of the church (2 Cor. 7:6). Upon hearing the encouraging report of Titus, Paul rejoiced that his letter was well received this time around and the Corinthians exhibited repentance and obedience (2 Cor. 7:7).</p> <p>Another development that had happened in Corinth since Paul wrote 1 Corinthians was the emergence of some antagonists who raised objections to some of Paul&rsquo;s teaching and considered him to be an &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; apostle (2 Cor. 11:5; 12:11). It appears that these were fellow Christians who were claiming to be apostles with knowledge superior to that of Paul (Paul ironically refers to them as &ldquo;super-apostles&rdquo;), and they were criticizing and undermining Paul&rsquo;s ministry efforts by speaking out against him and teaching a different gospel that led people away from their devotion to Christ (2 Cor. 11:3). It is unknown whether these were resident believers in Corinth who decided to assume authority within the church, or if they were traveling missionaries like Paul from elsewhere who had recently arrived in Corinth. The fact that Paul wrote about traveling teachers needing letters of recommendation favors the position that they were likely traveling teachers (2 Cor. 3:1-2). Whichever the case, they were interfering and destroying the trust of those in Corinth and causing them to turn away from Paul and the message of the good news he had delivered unto them.</p> <p><strong>Purpose for Writing:</strong> Following Paul&rsquo;s composition of 1 Corinthians and his second visit to Corinth, there still remained a rift with the congregation due to their continued practice of immorality and internal rivalry. After Paul wrote his &ldquo;tearful letter,&rdquo; the return of Titus and the news of the state of the Corinthian church was the reason the Lord directed Paul to pen yet another letter. The news that Titus delivered led Paul to decide not to return to Corinth on his way to Macedonia but to reserve his visit until after he visited Macedonia. This elicited accusations against Paul for being insincere and fickle and not remaining true to his word. Against such accusations, Paul felt the need to defend himself and explain the grounds for his sudden change of mind (2 Cor. 1:12-2:4).</p> <p>In 2 Corinthians, Paul addresses a number of issues within the congregation concerning their view of his ministry, the message of the good news, and his apostleship. He also presents his case against the false apostles who were stirring up trouble by speaking out and discrediting his authority and distorting the message of the good news he preached. But Paul also writes this letter in an attempt to express his joy for how many of the Corinthians had been restored to him and took his rebuke to heart and changed their behavior.</p> <p>Throughout the letter, it is apparent that Paul&rsquo;s motives for writing were to exhibit his concern for this congregation, to convey the joy he feels on account of Titus&rsquo; report that they have repented and turned from their past wrongdoing, and to pastor this unstable church through competing views from these so-called &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; who had been misguiding them and poisoning the Corinthians&rsquo; view of him.</p> <p>Moreover, Paul dedicates considerable space in the letter to discussing his ministry efforts for the poor believers in Jerusalem and his intention to come and collect the offering that the Corinthians promised they would prepare for him (2 Cor. 8-9; cf. Rom. 15:28; 1 Cor. 16:1-4). Within this section, Paul seeks to discuss financial giving to those in need and the ministering that such giving enables. In addition, Paul mentions that such giving is a demonstration of love (2 Cor. 8:24), and that when it comes to giving, &ldquo;the one who sows little will reap little, but the one who sows generously will reap generously&rdquo; (2 Cor. 9:6).</p> <p>Paul closes the letter by explaining that he desires the Corinthians to test themselves whether they are in the faith and also to become strong and mature believers (2 Cor. 13:5, 9). But Paul also mentions that he is writing in a severe tone now so that when he does come visit, he will not have to reprove them in that way in person (2 Cor. 13:10).</p> <p><strong>Message:</strong> Second Corinthians can be divided up into several major sections each addressing a particular core issue surrounding what was going on at the church in Corinth during Paul&rsquo;s absence. These issues are a response according to the report that Paul received from Titus after he wrote his &ldquo;tearful letter&rdquo; (2 Cor. 2:4).</p> <p>In the first section (2 Cor. 1:12-2:13), Paul begins by addressing the charges of being unreliable in the eyes of the Corinthians, which was derived from the Corinthians&rsquo; perception of his abrupt change of plans to not come and visit them on his way to Macedonia (2 Cor. 1:15-17). It seems the Corinthians were accusing Paul of being fickle and capricious in telling them &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; (he will visit) and then changing his mind and saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; (he will not visit). Paul defends himself in the face of these allegations by claiming his change of plans was not on account of his lack of desire to see them or any indecisiveness, but because he wanted to spare them the pain associated with his rebuke of their behavior, which he seems to have warned them about in his &ldquo;tearful letter&rdquo; (2 Cor. 1:23-2:4). This rebuttal stands paramount because the Corinthians would likely question the good news that was preached among them if the messengers who preached it were not trustworthy themselves.</p> <p>In the next section (2 Cor. 2:14-7:16), Paul launches into a lengthy defense of his ministry as an apostle that is aimed at defending the validity of his position in response to some apparent agitators who were questioning the legitimacy of his apostleship. Paul rhetorically questions, &ldquo;Who is competent [for the work of the ministry]?&rdquo; (2:16), and then proceeds to enter into a contrast with his own God-given appointment as a minister of the new covenant and the false notion that some Corinthians felt he should have letters of recommendation to validate his authority. Paul&rsquo;s answer to this is that his ministry is not one of the letter, but of the spirit, for he has been made a competent minister of the new covenant by God (2 Cor. 3:1-6). This new covenant is far more glorious than the old as it is permanent, brings righteousness, and reveals the glory of the Lord, unlike the old covenant which brought condemnation, was temporary, and is now fading away (2 Cor. 3:7-4:6). But even in the weakness of human flesh, Paul preaches this life-giving gospel for the benefit of the Corinthians amidst much persecution and suffering because of the hope that, while his body might perish, he will be raised from the dead by the Lord Jesus and receive the &ldquo;incomparable eternal weight of glory&rdquo; (2 Cor. 4:7-18).</p> <p>And in the same way that the old covenant was temporary, being replaced by an even more glorious covenant, so too our physical bodies, which are temporary, will be replaced one day by an even more glorious heavenly body (2 Cor. 5:1-10). And because God will judge each person, Paul feels persuaded to preach the good news out of a pure motive and on account of the love of Christ, who died for everyone so that those who live through him will no longer live to themselves (2 Cor. 5:11-15). This is because, through the good news about Christ, all who believe have become a new creation in Christ, old things have passed away, and God has reconciled all things unto himself in Christ (2 Cor. 5:16-21).</p> <p>Paul then comes full circle and appeals to the Corinthians for them to consider the good news of reconciliation and the grace of God, and how he has labored so diligently to preach this message amidst extreme hardships and persecution (2 Cor. 6:1-10). Furthermore, Paul adds that his desire is that the Corinthians match him in his acceptance and openness toward them (2 Cor. 6:11-13). In a further attempt to implore the Corinthians to open their hearts to him, Paul conveys how much he is rejoicing over them in hearing from Titus that they have repented and become obedient (2 Cor. 7:1-16).</p> <p>In the following section (2 Cor. 8:1-9:15), Paul switches gears and takes up the issue of the collection for the believers in Jerusalem that the Corinthians had promised they would gather and have prepared. However, even with all the repentance and obedience that the Corinthians showed since Paul&rsquo;s previous visit and the writing of his harsh letter, their promised offering still remained incomplete (2 Cor. 8:8-11). Paul wanted the Corinthians to finish the task of preparing the collection and to view the sharing of their financial abundance with those in need as a way of demonstrating their love and equality (2 Cor. 8:8, 11-14). Within this section, Paul also addresses the nature of generous giving and sharing in the body of Christ and how one&rsquo;s abundance can provide for the lack of another, but it is God who ultimately provides what each person needs (2 Cor. 8:8-15; 9:6-15).</p> <p>In the final section (2 Cor. 10:1-13:10), Paul seems to pick back up from 2 Corinthians 2:17-3:3 where he mentions other preachers who peddle the gospel for profit and challenge his apostolic ministry. Against these &ldquo;false apostles&rdquo; (2 Cor. 11:13), Paul defends himself and also counters their malevolent accusations by establishing that he is not commending himself or venturing outside of the ministry that God has given him; rather he is working and boasting only in those things that God has assigned to him (2 Cor. 10:1-18). In response to all the personal attacks from his opponents, Paul feels that he must speak in bold terms as a &ldquo;fool&rdquo; in order to cut through the noise of his opponents in order to get the Corinthians to understand what is actually happening (2 Cor. 11:1, 16-19). And so, Paul engages his opponents head-on by tackling their slanderous allegations one by one, dismantling their arguments.</p> <p>First, Paul combats the accusation that his message was not legitimate because he was a poor public speaker by saying that even though he was not a trained orator, he was not &ldquo;unskillful&rdquo; in knowledge (2 Cor. 11:3-6). Secondly, Paul explicitly distances himself from his opponents in regard to receiving financial support for his ministry. Apparently, some of Paul&rsquo;s opponents were claiming to be equal with Paul, saying that they were just asking for financial support from the Corinthians like Paul was&mdash;a claim which Paul quickly refutes by reminding the Corinthians that he did not ask or receive any financial help from them. Instead, he actually used money from other churches to support himself while he was preaching the good news and ministering in Corinth (2 Cor. 11:7-15).</p> <p>Paul continues upbraiding the accusations of his opponents (who were likely boasting in their achievements) by boasting in his weaknesses, non-achievements, and sufferings (2 Cor. 11:17-33). In addition, Paul refuses to boast in visions and revelations, though, by all means, he certainly could (2 Cor. 12:1-7). And in a climactic proclamation, Paul asserts that at the very core of the gospel message is the paradox that strength does not depend upon one&rsquo;s own prowess or abilities or receiving visions and revelations, but that Christ&rsquo;s power is &ldquo;made perfect in weakness&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:9). And if these credentials are still insufficient for the Corinthians, Paul goes on to proclaim how other signs, miracles, and wonders were done by him, which are the true signs of an apostle (2 Cor. 12:11-12).</p> <p>In closing his letter, Paul indicates his intention to come to visit a third time (2 Cor. 12:4, 20; 13:1). He reminds the Corinthians of the purity and blamelessness with which he has conducted himself toward them, both personally and with respect to the delegates that he has sent to them (Titus and &ldquo;the brother,&rdquo; 2 Cor. 12:14-18). But Paul also warns the Corinthians that he fears that he will arrive there, and they will not have corrected their wrong behavior, and so he will then have to execute judgment (2 Cor. 12:20-13:3). Thus, Paul exhorts the Corinthians to &ldquo;test themselves&rdquo; in the faith and prove that they pass the test so that Paul will not have to &ldquo;use severity&rdquo; when he comes (2 Cor. 13:5-10). Lastly, Paul closes the letter with final greetings and a typical benediction (2 Cor. 13:11-13).</p>'),

The term &ldquo;Galatians&rdquo; was an ambiguous term in the first century <span style="font-size:110%;font-variant:small-caps;">ad</span> that was used both ethnically and politically. Ethnically, it represented the population of Gaul invaders (from modern France) in the third century <span style="font-size:110%;font-variant:small-caps;">bc</span>, who took up residence in what is now north-central Turkey. But in the first century <span style="font-size:110%;font-variant:small-caps;">ad</span>, the term &ldquo;Galatia&rdquo; was also used politically by the Roman Empire to designate a particular province in Asia Minor, which is located in modern south-central Turkey. It is known from the record of Paul&rsquo;s missionary journeys in Acts that he traveled through the Roman province of Galatia as Acts 13:14-14:23 mentions him visiting several cities in that region (e.g., Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe). But some scholars have postulated that Paul must have been referring to the northern territory of Galatia on account of the way he used geographic terminology, his omission of Galatia in recounting his journey through Syria and Cilicia (Gal. 1:21), and the absence of mentioning how he was persecuted in many of the cities when traveling through the southern region. But archaeological evidence and recent scholarship on Paul&rsquo;s use of Greek terminology have led to the conclusion that Paul was most likely referring to churches located in the southern territory of provincial Galatia. Therefore, Paul would have written the letter early on (<span style="font-size:110%;font-variant:small-caps;">ad</span> ~48), prior to his trip to Jerusalem and the convening of the Jerusalem council (Acts 15).</p> <p><strong>Biblical Canon:</strong> The Letter to the Galatians follows the Letters to the Corinthians as another of Paul&rsquo;s writings in the collection known as the &ldquo;Church Epistles,&rdquo; written to early Christian communities. These were letters he wrote to many communities which he had personally founded or was interested in doing the work of ministry among them.</p> <p>Depending on the identity of the churches of Galatia, Galatians might very well be the first letter Paul wrote. But, as some have noted, with its strong parallel content to the Letter to the Romans, Galatians might have been written later near the time of the writing of Romans. As mentioned above, the archaeological and linguistic evidence seems to favor the conclusion that Galatians was the earliest of Paul&rsquo;s letters. But apart from the question of dating the composition, Galatians is a very important writing in Paul&rsquo;s corpus of letters.</p> <p>As with many of Paul&rsquo;s other &ldquo;Church Letters,&rdquo; he weaves together doctrine, reproof, and correction in order to guide the believers in their faith and to reveal to them the understanding he had received by revelation concerning the administration of God&rsquo;s grace, the gift of the holy spirit, God&rsquo;s secret plan for the joining together of both Jew and Gentile in Christ&rsquo;s body, the promise of redemption and salvation, and proper Christian behavior both inside and outside the church. Furthermore, in Galatians Paul focuses intently on God&rsquo;s redemptive plan for humanity and the proper relationship of the Law to faith in Christ. Justification and the faithfulness of God are two major themes that Paul addresses with respect to the function and purpose of the Law and also faith in Christ according to God&rsquo;s redemptive plan.</p> <p><strong>Background:</strong> In the early years of the church, the followers of Jesus were viewed as a subsect in larger Judaism. The Romans, among whom the Jews and Christians lived, had not yet formally recognized the religious distinction between the Jews and Christians. One of the reasons was that observance of the Law was still a common practice among Jews who accepted and believed in Jesus as the Messiah. Christian Jews saw faith in the Messiah as part of what designated a person as a child of Abraham. However, observance of the Law was still maintained by many Christians, and some argued that it was a necessary part of what was required to be a legitimate recipient (i.e., heir) of God&rsquo;s covenant promise to Abraham.</p> <p>The Jewish perspective of who was inside God&rsquo;s covenant people and who was outside was delineated by observance of the Law (especially circumcision, dietary restrictions, ritual purity, Sabbath rest, and festival celebrations). The Christian Jews who came to the area of Galatia brought with them this typical Jewish perspective. They saw God&rsquo;s covenant people, who they considered children of Abraham and the ones to whom God would fulfill his covenant promises, as those who kept the Law. The Law that God gave to Abraham&rsquo;s descendants was the &ldquo;boundary marker&rdquo; which identified who was included in the blessing God promised to Abraham. Therefore, they espoused that if a Gentile wanted to be included in the covenant blessing, they were required to undergo circumcision and then continue to observe the stipulations of the Law, which marked a person out as a member of God&rsquo;s people.</p> <p><strong>Purpose for Writing:</strong> Paul and Barnabas had traveled through and evangelized the southern part of the province of Galatia during their first missionary journey (Acts 13:4-14:28). Their ministry efforts were met with much opposition by various opponents of the gospel; in fact, Paul and his traveling companions encountered resistance and hostility in nearly every place they preached. What can be discerned about the situation in the churches of Galatia is that apparently some Jewish-Christian missionaries had journeyed to the churches in Galatia and had begun to assert the necessity of submitting to Torah observance, especially the act of circumcision, in order to be considered as an heir of the covenant promises God made to Abraham, i.e., to be declared righteous and part of God&rsquo;s people who will receive salvation and the inheritance along with Abraham. This was completely contrary to the gospel message of righteousness through faith in Christ alone and was undermining the truth of the gospel pertaining to the unity of God&rsquo;s people in the spirit that Paul had preached.</p> <p><strong>Message:</strong> In response to certain &ldquo;agitators&rdquo; (i.e., zealous Jewish-Christian missionaries), who were teaching that Christ-followers needed to be Torah observant in addition to their faith in Christ, the Galatian churches had been thrown into a frenzy of confusion and were compromising the truth of the gospel (Gal. 1:6-7). The problem with these agitators who were &ldquo;troubling&rdquo; the Galatian churches is that their message was essentially a &ldquo;different gospel&rdquo; (Gal. 1:8-9). Paul sharply rebukes the possibility by adamantly declaring there is no &ldquo;other gospel&rdquo; than the one he preached. However, this &ldquo;other gospel&rdquo; that the Christian Judaizers were proclaiming apparently had some appeal to the Galatians because it had gained some traction in the churches of Galatia.</p> <p>Before addressing the issues with the &ldquo;other gospel&rdquo; that was being promoted by the Christian Judaizers, Paul launches into a defense of his own apostolic ministry and authority beginning with his conversion and early years when God called him to be an apostle (Gal. 1:11-24). Part of Paul&rsquo;s intention for this defense was to make a distinction between himself and the other apostles at the Jerusalem church so as to make clear that his apostolic authority was not derived from or inferior to theirs (Gal. 1:16-18). In conjunction with his apostolic calling and ministry, Paul also recounts an incident when he journeyed to Jerusalem to confer with the other apostles and present to them the gospel he preached (Gal. 2:1-2). The purpose for giving this history was to expose and establish the fact that the Jerusalem apostles did not &ldquo;add anything&rdquo; to Paul&rsquo;s gospel, and even gave him the &ldquo;right hand of fellowship,&rdquo; endorsing and confirming the validity of his message (Gal. 2:6-9).</p> <p>To demonstrate his apostolic authority in regard to the Jerusalem apostles, Paul describes an incident in Antioch where &ldquo;certain men who came from James&rdquo; bearing the representative authority of the Jerusalem church had influenced Peter (and even Barnabas) to the point that they ceased from having table fellowship with fellow Gentile Christian believers (Gal. 2:12-13). This was an immense infraction upon the gospel Paul preached. The traction of the Christian Judaizers is clearly portrayed in the way that even Barnabas, Paul&rsquo;s fellow companion in the ministry efforts to the Gentiles, and the rest of the Jewish Christians in Antioch were also led astray along with Peter in this hypocrisy (Gal. 2:13). This action was completely contrary to the truth of the gospel and Paul would not stand for this perversion of the gospel&rsquo;s message about the removal of the barrier between Jews and Gentiles (Gal. 2:14).</p> <p>Following the retelling of the Antioch incident, Paul launches into an extended argument to address the hypocrisy of Peter and the others, as well as to give a thorough refutation against the &ldquo;other gospel&rdquo; that the Christian Judaizers were advocating (Gal. 2:15-5:12). Paul&rsquo;s argument focuses on the polarity between &ldquo;the Law&rdquo; and &ldquo;faith in Christ&rdquo; and the meaning of each with respect to God&rsquo;s plan of redemption. To pose his thesis at the outset of this section, Paul states, &ldquo;We know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.&rdquo; (Gal. 2:16). The contention between Paul and the Christian Judaizers is not about the identity of Jesus as the Messiah&mdash;all parties involved acknowledged Jesus as God&rsquo;s anointed one&mdash;but rather the question revolved around whether observance of the Law had any continuing validity, necessity, or purpose in God&rsquo;s redemptive plan. The Christian Judaizers seemed to be in agreement that Gentiles were welcome to join in God&rsquo;s covenant people and be recipients of the promises God made to Abraham, but they needed to add to their faith in Christ the requirement of observing the Law, especially circumcision for males (Gal. 2:14).</p> <p>Paul&rsquo;s main claim is that observing the Law is not the basis for a person to be declared righteous before God&mdash;it is only by faith in Christ. Therefore, Paul concludes, if I &ldquo;rebuild&rdquo; the system I tore down, referring to the requirement of observing the Law as a means for being included in God&rsquo;s covenant people, then he simply proves that he is a &ldquo;lawbreaker&rdquo; for not keeping the requirements of the Law to begin with (Gal. 2:18). This would leave Paul with no more of a basis for being justified than when he was observing the Law at the start. Returning to Law observance is to return to a system that was never designed to or capable of accomplishing and bringing about the redemption that God&rsquo;s people needed.</p> <p>From this premise, Paul goes into a detailed defense showing the false logic behind holding the Law in a priority position as necessary for a person to be a recipient of God&rsquo;s justification and thereby included in his covenant people (Gal. 3:1-29). Paul prefaces his defense with the potent question: &ldquo;Did you [Galatians] receive the spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith?&rdquo; (Gal. 3:2). The implied answer is that the spirit which the Galatians received came through believing in Jesus as Messiah, not through observing the Law. Therefore, &ldquo;faith in Christ&rdquo; versus &ldquo;works of the law&rdquo; becomes the dichotomy that Paul will seek to work through in order to explain the proper place and purpose of each in God&rsquo;s redemptive program.</p> <p>One of the main questions Paul is addressing could also be posed like this: &ldquo;Who are the true children of Abraham that God has given his spirit to? Is it those who observe the Law, or is it those who believe in Jesus as the Messiah?&rdquo; Paul washes away any misconceptions by making it unequivocally clear that the way a person is declared to be righteous before God has always been on the basis of one criterion, and one alone: faith. When God made a covenant with Abraham and promised him that &ldquo;all the nations would be blessed,&rdquo; God had in mind that He would &ldquo;justify the Gentiles by faith&rdquo; (Gal. 3:8). God has always justified a person on the basis of faith, and not only did the promise to Abraham exemplify this; even Abraham&rsquo;s own experience of justification testifies to this reality (Gal. 3:6). Therefore, those who also believe God like Abraham did are &ldquo;blessed with Abraham&rdquo; (Gal. 3:9).</p> <p>Elaborating upon how being declared right with God is through faith in Christ alone, Paul proceeds to demonstrate how the promise to Abraham is not dependent upon the Law that God gave to Abraham&rsquo;s descendants. And since being justified before God was never possible through the Law, then the giving of the Law must have fulfilled a different purpose in God&rsquo;s redemptive plan (Gal. 3:10-26).</p> <p>The premise for Paul&rsquo;s explanation rests on the fact that the Law came after God&rsquo;s covenant promises to Abraham by 430 years, and moreover, the Law was unable to do what God required from his people in order to be declared in a right relationship with Him (Gal. 3:17-18, 21). If righteousness was never achievable through observing the Law, then the question would naturally arise, &ldquo;What then was the reason God gave Abraham&rsquo;s descendants the Law?&rdquo; Paul, preempting this question, proceeds to give the answer using a common Greco-Roman cultural metaphor that would be understood by his audience.</p> <p>The Law was a &ldquo;custodian&rdquo; and &ldquo;guardian&rdquo; (Gal. 3:24-25) of God&rsquo;s people during the interim time between when the covenant promises were made and when the one by whom they would be fulfilled would eventually come&mdash;the &ldquo;seed,&rdquo; which is Christ (Gal. 3:16). The Law served a temporary purpose in God&rsquo;s redemptive plan until the consummative fulfillment would arrive in the coming of the Messiah. But now that the Messiah has come, God&rsquo;s people are no longer in need of a &ldquo;guardian.&rdquo; The Law is no longer in effect because its purpose is no longer needed. The Law which pointed forward has given way to what it pointed to (i.e., Christ), and therefore, there is no reason to return to what was limited and passing away, never able to bring God&rsquo;s people to be &ldquo;complete.&rdquo; After all this, Paul gives the punchline: Whoever belongs to Christ is Abraham&rsquo;s offspring and heirs of God&rsquo;s covenant promise (Gal. 3:29).</p> <p>From Paul&rsquo;s great proclamation of equality among all of God&rsquo;s people, i.e., &ldquo;there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female,&rdquo; (Gal. 3:28), and that those who are &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; (the &ldquo;seed&rdquo;) are Abraham&rsquo;s true children, he segues into illustrating the function of the Law in God&rsquo;s redemptive program by characterizing God&rsquo;s people as a &ldquo;child&rdquo; that needed supervision until they reached full age in order to &ldquo;inherit&rdquo; what was prepared by the father (Gal. 4:1-7). The premise Paul argues from is that after Christ came, God&rsquo;s people are no longer a &ldquo;child&rdquo; and &ldquo;slave&rdquo; needing a &ldquo;steward&rdquo; to look after them and guide them. Rather, God&rsquo;s people are now considered mature sons and daughters, and heirs of God (Gal. 4:7).</p> <p>Because the Galatian believers are to view themselves as having come to maturity by being &ldquo;in Christ,&rdquo; Paul is at pains wondering why they would desire to return to &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; by requiring observance of the Law (Gal. 4:9, 19-20). He probes further by questioning their understanding of the Law (Gal. 4:21). This leads into an extended allegory with well-known OT figures and places (e.g., Sarah, Hagar, Jerusalem, Sinai, etc.) that Paul presents in a complex and polemical fashion in order to illustrate the erroneous thinking of the Christian Judaizers and their mistaken perspective on the purpose and relation of God&rsquo;s covenants (Gal. 4:21-31).</p> <p>In describing the Galatian believers as children of the &ldquo;free woman&rdquo; (Gal. 4:31), Paul advances his reasoning to explicate what it means to be &ldquo;free&rdquo; in Christ as opposed to being in &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; to observe the Law (Gal. 5:1-5). The contrast between life in the spirit is set against observance of the Law, but Paul declares that what ultimately matters is &ldquo;faith working through love&rdquo; (Gal. 5:6). That is why Paul admonishes the Galatian believers to understand that &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; in Christ is not &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; from the Law, but &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; to fulfill the Law through love and walking according to the spirit (Gal. 5:13-18). This is because those who &ldquo;belong to Christ&rdquo; do not walk according to the flesh but have &ldquo;crucified the flesh&rdquo; (Gal. 5:24). And those who are in Christ, having crucified the flesh, live by the spirit and follow the leading of the spirit (Gal. 5:25).</p> <p>In the last section of Paul&rsquo;s argument, he gives practical instructions for how believers are to live together in community by the spirit through displays of genuine love and care for one another (Gal. 6:1-10). Paul&rsquo;s practical directives and exhortations are aimed at helping the Galatian community realize the responsibility each person must bear for themselves but also the mandate to be involved with and help each other as well.</p> <p>Paul concludes the letter by giving a traditional epistolary postscript in his own hand to authenticate the letter as coming from him personally (Gal. 6:11). But following the postscript, Paul does not include any greetings or doxology or farewell prayer as is his usual custom in his other letters. Instead, he presents several warning statements to reiterate his concern for the Galatians (Gal. 6:12-17). Paul&rsquo;s main point is that the Christian Judaizers are attempting to &ldquo;compel&rdquo; the Galatians to be circumcised (i.e., observance of the Law), which is actually contrary to the meaning of the cross and is motivated by selfish appeal to avoid being persecuted for their faith in Christ (Gal. 6:12-13). These exhortations are offered as a means to bring to a close his arguments in the letter and to give some final guidance and encouragement to the Galatians in the face of this attack on the gospel. For his last remark, Paul gives his final &ldquo;standard&rdquo;&mdash;the Galatians are to maintain their faith in Jesus Christ and to continue to walk according to the new life in the spirit as part of God&rsquo;s new creation (Gal. 6:14-16).</p>'),

As the name &ldquo;Titus&rdquo; suggests and Paul stated, Titus was a Roman of Greek nationality (Gal. 2:3), who was converted by Paul quite early in Paul&rsquo;s ministry (Tit. 1:4; Gal. 2:1). Titus was a faithful man and gifted leader, and he had traveled with Paul to Jerusalem early in Paul&rsquo;s ministry (Gal. 2:1-4). Also fairly early on, Titus went to Corinth to help with the work there, and so is mentioned in 2 Corinthians 2:12-13; 7:5-6; and 8:6.</p> <p>After completing three missionary journeys, Paul was imprisoned in Caesarea for two years (Acts 24:27), then traveled by ship to Rome (Acts 27:1-28:16), then was imprisoned in Rome for two more whole years (Acts 28:30; c. 60-62 AD). When he was finally released, Paul traveled again and at some point was joined by Titus, who accompanied him to Crete. The island of Crete is the fourth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea and was a Roman province. The population there was mainly farmers and fruit growers.</p> <p>There was so much work to be done to establish the church in Crete that Paul left Titus there to continue the work (Titus 1:5). However, Paul still felt he needed Titus with him in other places, so he planned to send a replacement for Titus and asked Titus to join him in Nicopolis (Tit. 3:12). Nicopolis, &ldquo;City of Victory,&rdquo; was a city in Epirus, a region in northwest Greece and a Roman province. Titus must have joined Paul there because by 2 Timothy, which Paul penned after he wrote the Epistle of Titus, Titus had traveled north into Dalmatia, which is in what is now Yugoslavia (2 Tim. 4:10). That Paul left Titus in Crete to continue the work shows the great trust that Paul had for Titus because the people in Crete would have been difficult to lead. Apparently, the people of Crete were so bad that they were proverbial in the Roman world for being liars, evil, lazy, and money-grubbing (Tit. 1:10-13). Thus the Cretans were Proverbial for being lazy liars in a similar way that the people of Corinth were proverbial for their sexual excesses.</p> <p>The Epistle of Titus does not tell us where Paul was when he penned Titus, although because he was on his way to Nicopolis and had decided to spend the winter there (Tit. 3:12), many scholars believe he was probably at Corinth. Also, the Bible does not explicitly say how the Epistle of Titus got to Titus on Crete, but it was likely carried there by Zenas and Apollos as they traveled through (Tit. 3:13). Paul penned Titus sometime after he was released from his first imprisonment but before his second imprisonment in Rome, at which time he wrote his last epistle, 2 Timothy, shortly after which he was executed. Thus Titus was written in the mid-60s AD (c. 65-66).</p> <p>Although the Epistle of Titus addresses many issues, two notable themes are the importance of leaders and their families to be people of sterling character (Tit. 1:5-9) and the necessity for believers to do what is good (Tit. 1:16; 2:7, 12-14; 3:1, 8, 14). Given the evil, lazy reputation of the people of Crete, having good character and living a good life would certainly set the Christians apart and also make the Good News about Jesus Christ attractive to others (cp. Tit. 2:10). Also, Titus has information about false teachers and divisive people and the harm they do to the Church, and thus the need for leaders who know and follow the truth and are of good character.</p>'),
